# ml-classification-repo
A classification of texts based on automated labeling and tranfsormers

This repository was developed as part of the master thesis "Analysis and automated labeling of topics and trends in the German
automotive industry using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing based on of industry-specific website content." generated and developed. 
In the context of this work, a BERT-based classification algorithm is trained and developed that can identify and classify topics and trends of a predefined industry.

## Install

## Usage
The generated classifier can classify random texts into the industry-specific topics and trends and returns the most appropriate topic to which the text is related. 

## Descrption
The general steps to develop the classifier are as follows:
{
1. Data mining and crawling of website text content using seed url list and seed keywords.
2. Data cleansing and topic extraction of website text content (one sample is one website link)
3. Automated labeling of cleaned website text content and of topics.
4. Train Classification model (BERT).
