{'CLASS': 'SHARED', 'DOMAIN': 'en.wikipedia.org', 'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_subscription', 'URL_TEXT': '\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Vehicle subscription|\n|\n|From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia|\n|\n|\n|\n|Jump to navigation|\n|Jump to search|\n|\n|\n|Not to be confused with |Carsharing|.|\n|\n|Vehicle subscription| is a |service| where a customer pays a recurring |fee| for the right to use one or more |automotive vehicles|. Some vehicle subscriptions offer |insurance| and |maintenance| as part of the subscription fee; other subscriptions allow the |subscriber| to switch between different vehicles during their subscription period. Industry commentators consider vehicle subscription to be an alternative to |owning| or |leasing| a vehicle.|[1]|[2]|\n|Vehicle subscriptions have been available since 2010 when Rima Braden of Autosource, LLC offered a short-term flexible auto acquisition program from his dealership in Honolulu, Hawaii that he coined "Flexlease".  Rebranded as "Carousel" in 2013, the program was restricted to the city and county of Honolulu and remains in operation today.  In 2014 flexdrive, now jointly owned by |Cox Automotive| and Holman Enterprises, launched.|[3]| Clutch Technologies, a start-up, launched a subscription service for consumers in |Atlanta| in mid-2014; Flow Automotive Companies was the first |automotive| |dealership| to offer a subscription service, launching Drive Flow in |Winston-Salem| in 2016, using Clutch\'s technology platform.|[4]| 2017 saw several automotive |manufacturers| announce and launch subscription services, including Book by Cadillac, Porsche Passport, Care by Volvo and |Canvas| (backed by |Ford Motor Company|).|[5]| By 2018, a number of startups and automotive |dealership| companies had launched subscriptions in multiple markets |[6]| and flexdrive became the first U.S.-based car subscription company to support dealerships and fleet operators stateside and globally through its partnership with Dribe in Denmark.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Definition|\n|2| |Common features|\n|3| |Types of providers and business models|\n|\n|3.1| |Automotive manufacturers|\n|3.2| |Automotive dealerships|\n|3.3| |Start-ups and corporate-backed ventures|\n|3.4| |Car subscription software providers|\n|3.5| |Other providers|\n|\n|\n|4| |References|\n|\n|\n|Definition|\n|Vehicle subscriptions are a type of |subscription business model| where a customer pays a periodic fee for the use of one or more vehicles. The difference between a vehicle subscription and buying a vehicle is that the subscription service retains ownership of the vehicle. While vehicle subscriptions and traditional automotive |leases| both involve recurring payments, many subscription services offer more flexibility in terms of minimum term and the ability to swap between vehicles.|[1]| The main difference between vehicle subscriptions and |vehicle or car rental| is that most subscriptions are designed to offer full-time possession of a vehicle such that the subscription replaces the customer\'s primary vehicle, whereas rental involves the effort of procuring vehicles for specific dates or trips.|[7]|\n|Vehicle subscriptions have been variously been identified as part of the "|sharing economy|" or part of the "subscription economy".|[8]|[9]| Vehicle subscriptions have also been classified as a form of "|transportation-as-a-service"| and as a form of "mobility-as-a-service".|[10]|[11]|\n|\n|Common features|\n|Edmunds.com observes that there is a wide variety in the types of vehicle subscriptions that are available, such that many different customer needs can be met across the various services. Most vehicle subscriptions allow customers to pay a flat periodic fee, typically on a monthly basis. Whereas some subscription offerings have no minimum term (e.g., Book by Cadillac), others do have a minimum term (e.g., Care by Volvo launched with a two-year minimum term). Vehicle subscriptions include flat-rate, no-haggle pricing. Prospective customers typically sign-up using an app. The monthly fee may include insurance, maintenance and roadside assistance. Some services include a mileage limit and some offer unlimited mileage. Several services, such as Carousel, Porsche Passport and Book by Cadillac, offer the option to swap between different types of vehicles. Some services offer unlimited swaps and some restrict the number of swaps.|[1]|[2]|[12]|[5]|\n|\n|Types of providers and business models|\n|Vehicle subscriptions are offered by several different categories of company. Each category is pursuing a slightly different business model.\n|\n|Automotive manufacturers|\n|Several automotive manufacturers and brands offer or have announced vehicle subscriptions, including |Porsche|, |Volvo|, |Cadillac|, |Hyundai|, |Mercedes Benz|, |BMW|,  |Lexus| and Ford. These services offer subscribers vehicles from a single brand or, in the case of Volvo, a single vehicle. While initial launches have tended to focus on one or two cities,|[13]|[14]| there is evidence that the manufacturers will eventually offer their services more broadly: for example Care by Volvo was immediately available across the country and Book by Cadillac has expanded beyond its original launch market of New York City.|[15]|[16]|\n|The manufacturers have announced various objectives for these programs. Volvo has described the objective of Care by Volvo as to provide convenience by offering access, insurance, maintenance and support within a single package.|[17]| Cadillac has described the objective of Book by Cadillac as being to grow the number of Cadillac drivers, particularly those who are new to the brand.|[18]| Porsche has described their Passport service as a way to cater to customers with highly varied lives.|[10]| Ford has described Canvas as a way to grow the number of Ford drivers while also controlling the number of used vehicles hitting automotive auctions.|[11]|\n|In April 2018 the |BMW Group| started their own vehicle subscription service Access by BMW as a trial in Nashville, Tennessee. Access is currently available in USA and Singapore.\n|In May 2020 the BMW Group started their own vehicle subscription service in MINI Subscribe. MINI Subscribe is currently available in major German cities such as Munich and Hamburg, offering a range of models including the iconic MINI Cooper, MINI Cooper SE and the MINI Cooper Countryman.\n|\n|Automotive dealerships|\n|A number of automotive dealerships have launched vehicle subscriptions focused on the markets where they have stores. The services offered by these dealerships typically include vehicles from several different brands offered by their stores, allowing customers to drive a wide variety of vehicles. Examples:\n|\n|The Jeff Wyler Automotive Group offers a subscription service, Wyler Fastlane, in their home market of Cincinnati.|\n|Flow Automotive|\n|Park Place Select in Dallas|[19]|\n|Inride, in the Washington DC/Baltimore area|\n|Carousel, based in Honolulu, Hawaii|\n|Portfolio by OpenRoad, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, launched in November 2018|\n|Start-ups and corporate-backed ventures|\n|This section |contains content that is written like |an advertisement|.| Please help |improve it| by removing |promotional content| and inappropriate |external links|, and by adding encyclopedic content written from a |neutral point of view|.| |(|June 2020|)| (|Learn how and when to remove this template message|)|\n|A large number of |start-ups| have been created to offer vehicle subscription services. One early pioneer in the vehicle subscription space was Joule.|[20]| Other USA-based start-ups include Go,|[21]| Carma, Borrow,|[22]|  and Mobiliti.|[23]| Several vehicle subscription start-ups have been founded in Europe, including Wagonex, Cocoon Vehicles and |Drover|, from the United Kingdom, and Dribe and Bilabonnement, both from |Denmark|.|[24]|[25]|[26]| A UK based startup, Elmo, focuses on a subscription service exclusively for electric vehicles.|[27]| In 2017, |Gurgaon| based startup |Revv Cars|, launched monthly multi-brand car subscription program Switch across 15 cities in |India|.|[28]|\n|In 2018, another Indian company was launched. |Myles| Automotive Technologies (Delhi-based) is a multi-brand car subscription brand operating in all metropolitan cities.\n|Several established companies have created new |business units| that are offering vehicle subscriptions. In the US, |Cox Enterprises| launched flexdrive.|[29]| In Europe, |LeasePlan|, a vehicle leasing company, will offer subscriptions with their CarNext.com platform.|[30]|[31]|\n|VAI, a brazilian subscription service for ride-sharing drivers was founded in December 2017 in Sao Paulo.\n|The German company like2drive GmbH was founded in February 2018 as part of the Fleetpool Group.|[32]|\n|Cluno, a multi-brand car subscription service operating in Germany, was founded in October 2017.|[33]|\n|A car subscription service in Czech Republic, called Driveto Klub, was launched in October 2018 by Driveto.|[34]| Driveto was founded in Prague in 2017 and started as an online aggregator of |operating lease| offers. The majority of the start-up is owned by |Miton|, an online investment group from |Jablonec nad Nisou|.\n|Australia\'s car subscription services|[35]| include Carbar, HelloCars and Carly, all of which were launched in early 2019. As registered Victorian and NSW motor dealers, Carbar and HelloCars subscription vehicles are owned and operated by their respective companies while Carly utilises peer-to-peer customer vehicles offered in partnership with sister company DriveMyCar Rentals Pty Ltd. In addition to retail car subscription providers, the Australian market has also seen the launch of Loopit, a software platform enabling OEMs, dealerships and rental car companies to launch and manage their own car subscription product.\n|A pioneer in the Swiss vehicle subscription market is Carvolution AG, launched in 2018,|[36]| supported a 50 million CHF investment by the insurance group |Die Mobiliar Versicherungsgesellschaft AG|[37]| In partnerships with |Mobilezone Holding AG|[38]| and |LIDL|,|[39]| the start-up holds around 80% of the market share.|[40]|[41]|\n|CARIFY, with the largest selection of cars of similar ventures in Switzerland, was founded in September 2019 by Sergio Studer and Raffael Fiechter.|[42]|\n|Vehicle subscription has also begun to flourish in the Middle East, with Invygo launching the region\'s first car subscription app in March 2019.|[43]|\n|\n|Car subscription software providers|\n|Loopit (formerly Blinker Subscription) was launched in Australia in August 2019 and provides car subscription software to automotive manufacturers, car dealerships, car subscription companies and other related businesses to operate their own vehicle subscription service. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Loopit experienced a 52% increase in enquiries from car dealerships looking to introduce a car subscription model during the shutdown.|[44]|\n|\n|Other providers|\n|Zipcar| is offering a version of vehicle subscription, dubbed Zipcar Commuter, that provides dedicated possession of a vehicle from Monday to Friday.|[45]|\n|\n|References|\n|\n|\n|^ |a| |b| |c| |"What Are Car Subscription Services? | Edmunds"|. |Edmunds|. 10 January 2018|.

OnStar was created by GM working with |Motorola| Automotive (that was later bought by Continental). The primary purpose was safety and to get emergency help to a vehicle when there was an accident. The sooner medical helps arrives the more likely the drivers and passengers would survive. A cellular telephone call would be routed to a |call center| where the agent sent help.|[5]|\n|At first, OnStar only worked with voice but when cellular systems added data the system was able to send the |GPS| location to the call center. After the success of OnStar, many automakers followed with similar safety programs that usually come with a free trial for a new car and then a paid subscription after the trial is over.\n|Remote diagnostics| were introduced in 2001. By 2003 connected car services included vehicle health reports, |turn-by-turn directions| and a network access device. Data-only |telematics| were first offered in 2007.\n|In the summer of 2014, Audi was the first automaker to offer 4G |LTE| Wi-Fi |Hotspots| access and the first mass deployment of 4G LTE was by General Motors.\n|By 2015, OnStar had processed 1 billion requests from customers.|[6]|\n|AA plc| (formerly known as The Automobile Association) introduced Car Genie, the first piece of connected car technology in the UK that connects directly to a breakdown service, not only warning of issues with car health, but intervening directly with a phone call to customers to help them prevent a breakdown.|[7]|\n|In 2017, European technology start-up |Stratio Automotive| provides over 10,000 vehicles |predictive intelligence| enabling fleet operators to better manage and maintain their vehicles.|[8]|\n|\n|Types of connectivity|[|edit|]|\n|There are 5 ways a vehicle can be connected to its surroundings and communicate with them:|[9]|\n|\n|V2I "|Vehicle to Infrastructure|": The technology captures data generated by the vehicle and provides information about the infrastructure to the driver. The V2I technology communicates information about safety, mobility or environment-related conditions.|[10]|\n|V2V "|Vehicle to Vehicle|": The technology communicates information about speed and position of surrounding vehicles through a wireless exchange of information. The goal is to avoid accidents, ease traffic congestions and have a positive impact on the environment.|[11]|\n|V2C "|Vehicle to Cloud|": The technology exchanges information about and for applications of the vehicle with a |cloud| system. This allows the vehicle to use information from other, though the cloud connected industries like energy, transportation and smart homes and make use of |IoT|.|[12]|\n|V2P "|Vehicle to Pedestrian|":  The technology senses information about its environment and communicates it to other vehicles, infrastructure and personal mobile devices. This enables the vehicle to communicate with pedestrians and is intended to improve safety and mobility on the road.|[13]|\n|V2X "|Vehicle to Everything|": The technology interconnects all types of vehicles and infrastructure systems with another. This connectivity includes cars, highways, ships, trains and airplanes.|[14]|\n|Categories of applications|[|edit|]|\n|Applications can be separated into two categories:\n|\n|Single vehicle applications: In-car content and service applications implemented by a single vehicle in connection with a cloud or backoffice.|\n|Cooperative safety and efficiency applications: they provide connectivity between vehicles (or infrastructure) directly have to work cross-brand and cross-borders and require standards and regulation. Some may be convenience applications, others safety, which may require regulation.|\n|Examples include, amongst others: \n|\n|Single-vehicle applications: concierge features provided by automakers or apps alert the driver of the time to leave to arrive on time from a calendar and send text message alerts to friends or business associates to alert them of arrival times such as BMW Connected NA that also helps find parking or |gas stations|.|[15]| The European |eCall| would be an example of a single vehicle safety application that is mandatory in the |EU|.|[16]|\n|Cooperative safety-of-life and cooperative efficiency: |forward collision warning|, |lane change warning/blind spot warning|, emergency brake light warning, intersection movement assist, emergency vehicle approaching, road works warning, automatic notification of crashes, notification of speeding and safety alerts.|[17]|[18]|\n|The connected car segment can be further classified into eight categories.|[19]|\n|\n|Mobility management|: functions that allow the driver to reach a destination quickly, safely, and in a cost-efficient manner (e.g.: Current traffic information, Parking lot or garage assistance, Optimised fuel consumption)|\n|Commerce|: functions enabling users to purchase good or services while on-the-go (e.g., fuel, food & beverage, parking, tolls)|\n|Vehicle management: functions that aid the driver in reducing operating costs and improving ease of use (e.g., vehicle condition and service reminders, remote operation, transfer of usage data)|\n|Breakdown prevention: connected to a breakdown service, with a back end algorithm predicting breakdowns and an outbound service intervening via phone, SMS or push notification|\n|Safety: functions that warn the driver of external hazards and internal responses of the vehicle to hazards  (e.g., emergency breaking, lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, blind spot object identification)|\n|Entertainment: functions involving the entertainment of the driver and passengers (e.g., smartphone interface, WLAN hotspot, music, video, Internet, social media, mobile office)|\n|Driver assistance: functions involving partially or fully automatic driving (e.g., operational assistance or autopilot in heavy traffic, in parking, or on highways)|\n|Well-being: functions involving the driver\'s comfort and ability and fitness to drive (e.g., fatigue detection, automatic environment adjustments to keep drivers alert, medical assistance)|\n|Single-vehicle applications|[|edit|]|\n|Current automobiles entail embedded |navigation systems|, smartphone integration and multimedia packages.|[20]| Typically, a connected car made after 2010 has a head-unit, |in car entertainment| unit, in-dash system with a screen from which the operations of the connections can be seen or managed by the driver. Types of functions that can be made include music/audio playing, smartphone apps, navigation, roadside assistance, voice commands, contextual help/offers, parking apps, engine controls and car diagnosis.|[5]|\n|On January 6, 2014, Google announced the formation of the |Open Automotive Alliance| (OAA) a global alliance of technology and auto industry leaders committed to bringing the Android platform to cars starting in 2014. The OAA includes Audi, GM, Google, Honda, Hyundai and Nvidia.|[21]|\n|On March 3, 2014, Apple announced a new system to connect iPhone 5/5c/5S to car infotainment units using iOS 7 to cars via a Lightning connector, called |CarPlay|.\n|Android Auto| was announced on June 25, 2014 to provide a way for Android smartphones to connect to car infotainment systems.\n|Increasingly, connected cars (and especially electric cars) are taking advantage of the rise of smartphones, and apps are available to interact with the car from any distance. Users can unlock their cars, check the status of batteries on electric cars, find the location of the car, or remotely activate the climate control system.\n|Innovations to be introduced until 2020 include the full integration of smartphone applications, such as the linkage of the smartphone calendar, displaying it on the car\'s windshield and automatic address searches in the navigation system for calendar entries.|[20]| In the longer term, navigation systems will be integrated in the windshield and through augmented reality project digital information, like alerts and traffic information, onto real images from the driver\'s perspective.|[20]|\n|Near-term innovations regarding Vehicle Relationship Management (VRM) entail advanced remote services, such as GPS tracking and personalized usage restrictions. Further, maintenance services like |over-the-air| tune-ups, requiring the collaboration of car dealers, OEMs and service centers, are under development.|[20]|\n|Despite various market drivers there are also barriers that have prevented the ultimate breakthrough of the connected car in the past few years. One of these is the fact that customers are reluctant to pay the extra costs associated with embedded connectivity and instead use their smartphones as solution for their in-car connectivity needs. Because this barrier is likely to continue, at least in the short-term, car manufacturers are turning to smartphone integration in an effort to satisfy consumer demand for connectivity.|[22]|\n|\n|Cooperative safety-of-life and efficiency|[|edit|]|\n|These services relate to |Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)|, that depend on the sensory input of more than one vehicle and enable instant reaction through automatic monitoring, alerting, braking and steering activities.|[23]| They depend on instant vehicle-to-vehicle communication, as well as infrastructure, functioning across brands and national borders and offering cross-brand and cross-border levels of privacy and security. The |US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)| for that reason has argued for regulation in its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on V2V Communication|[24]| and argued the case in US Congress.|[25]| NHTSA began the rule-making process on December 13, 2016, proposing to mandate dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology in new light vehicles.|[26]| Under this proposed rule, vehicles would broadcast a defined data packet, the "basic safety message" (BSM) up to ten times per second, indicating vehicle location, heading, and speed. In March, 2017, GM became the first US automaker to provide DSRC as standard equipment on a production automobile, the Cadillac CTS.|[27]| The US also has appropriate standards – |IEEE 802.11p| – and frequency rules|[28]| in place. In Europe a frequency is harmonised for transport safety|[29]| and a harmonised standard, called ETSI ITS-G5,|[30]| are in place. In the EU there is no push to oblige vehicle manufacturers to introduce connect. Discussions about a regulatory framework for privacy and security are ongoing.|[31]|\n|Technologically speaking cooperative applications can be implemented.|[32]| Here the regulatory framework is the main obstacle to implementation, questions like privacy and security need to be addressed. British weekly "The Economist" even argues that the matter is regulatory driven.|[33]|\n|\n|Hardware|[|edit|]|\n|The necessary hardware can be divided into built-in or brought-in connection systems. The built-in telematics boxes most commonly have a proprietary Internet connection via a |GSM| module and are integrated in the car IT system. Although most connected cars in the United States use the GSM operator |AT&T| with a GSM SIM such as the case with Volvo,|[34]| some cars such as the Hyundai Blue Link system utilizes |Verizon Wireless Enterprise|, a non-GSM CDMA operator.|[35]|\n|Most brought-in devices are plugged in the OBD (|on-board diagnostics|) port for electrification and access to vehicle data and can further be divided into two types of connection:\n|\n|Hardware relies on customers smartphone for the Internet connection or|\n|Hardware establishes proprietary internet connection via GSM module.|\n|All forms of hardware have typical use cases as drivers. The built-in solutions were mostly driven by safety regulations in Europe for an automated Emergency Call (abbr. |eCall|). The brought-in devices usually focus on one customer segment and one specific use case.|[36]|\n|\n|Insurance|[|edit|]|\n|The data provided by greater vehicle connectivity is impacting the car insurance industry.|[20]| Predictive-modeling and machine-learning technologies, as well as real-time data streaming, providing among others information on driving speed, routes and time, are changing insurers\' doing-of-business.|[20]|[37]| Early adopters have begun to adjust their offering to the developments in the automotive industry, leading them to transition from being pure insurance product provider to becoming insurance-service hybrids.|[37]|\n|Progressive, for example, has introduced its usage-based-insurance program, Snapshot, in 2008, which takes into account driving times and ability. The data gathered through an |onboard diagnostics device| allows the company to perform further personal and regional risk assessments.|[37]| \nAnother innovation being tested in the insurance industry regards |telematics| devices, which transmit vehicle and driver data through |wide-area networks| and are subsequently used to influence driving behavior, for legal purposes and the identification of fraudulent insurance claims. Further applications are dynamic risk profiles and improved customer segmentation.|[37]|\nFuture services include coaching on driving skills for fuel efficiency and safety reasons, the prediction of maintenance needs and providing advise to car owners regarding the best time to sell their car.|[37]|\n|\n|Trends|[|edit|]|\n|The following trends are strengthening the shift towards a fully developed connected cars industry, changing the concept of what is understood as a car and what are its functions.\n|Technological innovation in the field of connectivity is accelerating.|[38]| High-speed computers help make the car aware of its surroundings, which can transform manoeuvring a self-driving vehicle an increasing reality.|[39]|\n|There are initiatives to use |ethernet| technology to connect the sensors that allow for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Through the ethernet, network speed inside the vehicle can increase from one |megabit| to |gigabits|.|[40]| Further, ethernet uses switches that allow connections to any number of devices, reducing the amount of cabling required and thus the overall weight of the car. Moreover, it is more scalable, allowing devices and sensors to connect at different speeds and has the benefit of components being available off the shelf.|[41]|\n|In fact, research also shows that customers are willing to switch manufacturers just to be able to use mobile devices and connectivity. In 2014 there were 21% who were willing to do so whereas in 2015 this number climbed up to 37%. On top of that 32% of those customers would also be ready to pay for a service related to connectivity on top on a base model. This figure has been at 21% in 2014, one year before. The increase of customers willing to switch manufacturers and to pay for such services shows the increase in importance for connected cars.|[42]|\n|The |Internet of Things| will be used to provide mobile services in the car with high-speed Internet. This feature will enable real time traffic control, interaction with the car manufacturer service for remote diagnostics and improved company logistics automation. Moreover, in the beginning of the self-driven car era, internet will be used for information exchange between the cars for better route selection and accident reports.|[43]|\n|\n|Criticism|[|edit|]|\n|Drawbacks and Challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Although the connected car offers both benefits and excitement to the drivers, it also faces drawbacks and challenges;\n|\n|A major issue with the connected cars is hackability. The more it is connected to the Internet and to the system, it becomes more exposed to being penetrated from the outside. If the service and help can be provided from distance by |car-makers|, through that channel, |hackers| can access and control the car as well. In |Germany| and |Brazil|, 59% of car drivers are afraid to be hacked into their car if it is connected to the Internet. In the |U.S| there are 43% and in |China| 53% whereas the average lies at 54%.|[44]|\n|Reliability| is also a major concern. Cars, |sensor|, and network hardware will malfunction. The system has to deal with incorrect data, as well as faulty communications, such as denial of service attacks.|\n|Privacy is another dimension, both with hacking and with other uses. Sensitive data gathered from the car such as the location, driver\'s daily route, apps that are used, etc. are all susceptible to be hacked and used for unauthorised purposes,|[45]| as well as being used by businesses and government. In Germany for example 51% of car drivers do not want to use car-related connected services because they want to keep their privacy. In the U.S it is 45%, in Brazil 37% and in China 21% of the car drivers that think so. The average lies at 37%.|[44]|\n|A simple failure in the system, whether in the connected car, or elsewhere in the network, while on the |autonomous drive| can cause fatal consequences.|\n|Fighting the challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Changing the |design| of products: the way that the product is developed and the "maintenance-respond-architecture" play a crucial role. Companies have to focus on long term solutions in terms of design security because quick changes are costly and easy to circumvent. Integrating this sphere at the earliest stage possible when developing the product can be the right approach for the companies.|\n|Internal cooperation between departments of the company: product-security teams and corporate IT-security teams will have to work closely together in order to prevent the hackability of their devices. To do so, companies may create guidelines that minimize probabilities of bugs, and security gaps (software). Making modifying and patching systems easier can be another effect driven from that.|\n|Over-the-air updates: As short term solutions are also easy to solve problems a technology called OTA (over-the-air) becomes more and more important to OEMs. These OTA updates allow companies to quickly detect problems/attacks and prevent the malefactors to become active and attack the system. However, this is a very costly approach and companies have to know the architecture of their systems in detail to directly attack the issue not to lose money on inefficiency.|\n|Value chain| security: As companies are the final integrators of security systems they also have to control security all along the value chain. Also suppliers have to make sure that security plays the most important role for the mobile device. Taking the example of the procurement department, it has to make sure that the cybersecurity features of the final product are negotiated and available. The whole security issue starts at the beginning of the value chain. This approach can be used to actually define and shape future security standards in the industry and make sure that every player in the industry has the same understanding of the importance of security.|[46]|\n|Connected Car Service Features|[|edit|]|\n|Mobile App Service|\n|\n|\n|Manufacturer\n|\n|Service\n|\n|Mobile App\n|\n|Features (Compatible based on model)\n|\n|Safety

It is a |vehicular communication system| that incorporates other more specific types of communication as V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure), V2N (vehicle-to-network), V2V (|vehicle-to-vehicle|), V2P (vehicle-to-pedestrian), V2D (|vehicle-to-device|).\n|The main motivations for V2X are |road safety|, |traffic efficiency|, |energy savings|, and |mass surveillance|.  The U.S. |NHTSA| estimates a minimum of 13% reduction in traffic accidents if a V2V system were implemented, resulting in 439,000 fewer crashes per year.|[1]|  There are two types of V2X communication technology depending on the underlying technology being used: (1) |WLAN|-based, and (2) |cellular|-based.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |History|\n|2| |Technology overview|\n|\n|2.1| |802.11p (DSRC)|\n|2.2| |3GPP (C-V2X)|\n|\n|\n|3| |Use cases|\n|4| |Standardisation history|\n|\n|4.1| |IEEE 802.11p|\n|4.2| |3GPP|\n|\n|\n|5| |Regulatory history|\n|\n|5.1| |United States|\n|5.2| |Europe|\n|\n|\n|6| |Spectrum allocation|\n|7| |Consideration in the transition period|\n|8| |Further reading|\n|9| |See also|\n|10| |References|\n|11| |External links|\n|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|The history of working on vehicle-to-vehicle communication projects to increase safety, reduce accidents and driver assistance can be traced back to the 1970s with projects such as the US |Electronic Road Guidance System (ERGS)| and Japan\'s CACS.|[2]| Most milestones in the history of vehicle networks originate from the United States, Europe, and Japan.|[2]|\n|Standardization of WLAN-based V2X supersedes that of cellular-based V2X systems. |IEEE| first published the specification of WLAN-based V2X (|IEEE 802.11p|) in 2010.|[3]| It supports direct communication between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I).  This technology is referred to as Dedicated Short Range Communication (|DSRC|).  |DSRC| uses the underlying radio communication provided by 802.11p.\n|In 2016, Toyota became the first automaker globally to introduce automobiles equipped with V2X.  These vehicles use |DSRC| technology and are only for sale in Japan.  In 2017, GM became the second automaker to introduce V2X.  GM sells a Cadillac model in the United States that also is equipped with |DSRC| V2X.\n|In 2016, |3GPP| published V2X specifications based on |LTE| as the underlying technology. It is generally referred to as "cellular V2X" (C-V2X) to differentiate itself from the 802.11p based V2X technology.  In addition to the direct communication (V2V, V2I), C-V2X also supports wide area communication over a cellular network (V2N).\n|As of December 2017, a European automotive manufacturer has announced to deploy V2X technology based on 802.11p from 2019.|[4]| While some studies and analysis in 2017|[4]| and 2018,|[5]| all performed by the |5G Automotive Association| (5GAA) – the industry organisation supporting and developing the C-V2X technology – indicate that cellular-based C-V2X technology in direct communication mode is superior to 802.11p in multiple aspects, such as performance, communication range, and reliability, many of these claims are disputed, e.g. in a whitepaper published by NXP,|[6]| one of the companies active in the 802.11p based V2X technology,\nbut also published by peer-reviewed journals.|[7]|\n|\n|Technology overview|[|edit|]|\n|802.11p (DSRC)|[|edit|]|\n|The original V2X communication uses |WLAN| technology and works directly between vehicles (V2V) as well as vehicles and traffic infrastructure (V2I), which form a |vehicular ad-hoc network| as two V2X senders come within each other\'s range. Hence it does not require any communication infrastructure for vehicles to communicate, which is key to assure safety in remote or little-developed areas. WLAN is particularly well-suited for |V2X communication|, due to its low latency. It transmits messages known as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM)  or Basic Safety Message (BSM), and Decentralised Environmental Notification Messages (DENM). Other roadside infrastructure related messages are Signal Phase and Timing Message (SPAT), In Vehicle Information Message (IVI), and Service Request Message (SRM). The data volume of these messages is very low. The radio technology is part of the WLAN |IEEE 802.11| family of standards and known in the US as Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) and in Europe as ITS-G5.|[8]| To complement the direct communication mode, vehicles can be equipped with traditional cellular communication technologies, supporting V2N based services. This extension with V2N was achieved in Europe under the C-ITS platform umbrella|[9]| with cellular systems and broadcast systems (TMC/DAB+).\n|\n|3GPP (C-V2X)|[|edit|]|\n|More recent V2X communication uses |cellular networks| and is called |cellular V2X| (or C-V2X) to differentiate it from the WLAN-based V2X.  There have been multiple industry organizations, such as the |5G Automotive Association| (5GAA) promoting C-V2X due to its advantages over WLAN based V2X (without considering disadvantages at the same time).|[10]| C-V2X is initially defined as |LTE| in |3GPP| Release 14 and is designed to operate in several modes:\n|\n|Device-to-device (V2V or V2I), and|\n|Device-to-network (V2N).|\n|In 3GPP Release 15, the V2X functionalities are expanded to support |5G|. C-V2X includes support of both direct communication between vehicles (V2V) and traditional cellular-network based communication. Also, C-V2X provides a migration path to 5G based systems and services, which implies incompatibility and higher costs compared to 4G based solutions.\n|The direct communication between vehicle and other devices (V2V, V2I) uses so-called PC5 interface. PC5 refers to a reference point where the User Equipment (UE), i.e. mobile handset, directly communicates with another UE over the direct channel. In this case, the communication with the |base station| is not required. In system architectural level, proximity service (ProSe) is the feature that specifies the architecture of the direct communication between UEs.  In 3GPP RAN specifications, "sidelink" is the terminology to refer to the direct communication over PC5. PC5 interface was originally defined to address the needs of mission-critical communication for public safety community (Public Safety-LTE, or PS-LTE) in release 13. The motivation of the mission-critical communication was to allow law enforcement agencies or emergency rescue to use the LTE communication even when the infrastructure is not available, such as natural disaster scenario.  In release 14 onwards, the use of PC5 interface has been expanded to meet various market needs, such as communication involving wearable devices such as |smartwatch|.  In C-V2X, PC5 interface is re-applied to the direct communication in V2V and V2I.\n|The Cellular V2X mode 4 communication relies on a distributed resource allocation scheme, namely sensing-based semipersistent scheduling which schedules radio resources in a stand-alone fashion in each user equipment (UE).|[11]| |[12]|\n|[13]|\n|In addition to the direct communication over PC5, C-V2X also allows the C-V2X device to use the cellular network connection in the traditional manner over Uu interface.  Uu refers to the logical interface between the UE and the base station. This is generally referred to as vehicle-to-network (V2N). V2N is a unique use case to C-V2X and does not exist in 802.11p based V2X given that the latter supports direct communication only. However, similar to WLAN based V2X also in case of C-V2X, two communication radios are required to be able to communicate simultaneously via a PC5 interface with nearby stations and via the UU interface with the network.\n|While 3GPP defines the data transport features that enable V2X, it does not include V2X semantic content but proposes usage of ITS-G5 standards like CAM, DENM, BSM, etc. over 3GPP V2X data transport features.|[14]|\n|\n|Use cases|[|edit|]|\n|Through its instant communication V2X allows road safety applications such as (non-exhaustive list):\n|\n|Forward collision warning|\n|Lane change warning|/blind spot warning|\n|Emergency electric brake light warning|\n|Intersection movement assist|\n|Emergency vehicle| approaching|\n|Roadworks| warning|\n|Platooning|\n|The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\'s (NHTSA) report “Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications: Readiness of V2V Technology for Application“|[15]| lists the initial use cases envisioned for the US. European standardisation body |ETSI| and |SAE| published standards on what they see as use cases.|[16]|[17]| Early use cases focus on road safety and efficiency.|[18]| New and advanced use cases are introduced by organizations such as 3GPP, 5GAA, and 5GCAR, these use cases address high levels of automation.|[2]|\n|In the medium term V2X is perceived as a key enabler for autonomous driving, assuming it would be allowed to intervene into the actual driving. In that case vehicles would be able to join platoons, the way HGVs do. With the advent of connected and autonomous mobility, V2X discussions are seen to play an important role, especially in the context of teleoperations for autonomous vehicles |[19]| and platooning |[20]| |[21]|\n|\n|Standardisation history|[|edit|]|\n|IEEE 802.11p|[|edit|]|\n|WLAN-based V2X communication is based on a set of standards drafted by the |American Society for Testing and Materials| (ASTM). The ASTM E 2213 series of standards looks at wireless communication for high-speed information exchange between vehicles themselves as well as road infrastructure. The first standard of this series was published 2002. Here the acronym Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) was first used for V2X communication.\n|From 2004 onwards the |Institute Electrical and Electronics Engineers| (IEEE) started to work on wireless access for vehicles under the umbrella of their standards family IEEE 802.11 for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). Their initial standard for wireless communication for vehicles is known as |IEEE 802.11p| and is based on the work done by the ASTM. Later on in 2012 |IEEE 802.11p| was incorporated in IEEE 802.11.\n|Around 2007 when |IEEE 802.11p| got stable, IEEE started to develop the 1609.x standards family standardising applications and a security framework|[22]| (IEEE uses the term WAVE), and soon after |SAE| started to specify standards for V2V communication applications. SAE uses the term DSRC for this technology (this is how the term was coined in the US). In parallel at ETSI the technical committee for |Intelligent transportation system| (ITS) was founded and started to produce standards for protocols and applications|[23]| (ETSI coined the term ITS-G5). All these standards are based on IEEE 802.11p technology.\n|Between 2012 and 2013, the Japanese |Association of Radio Industries and Businesses| (ARIB) specified, also based on IEEE 802.11, a V2V and V2I communication system in the 700\xa0MHz frequency band.|[24]|\n|In 2015 |ITU| published as summary of all V2V and V2I standards that are worldwide in use, comprising the systems specified by ETSI, IEEE, ARIB, and TTA (Republic of Korea, Telecommunication Technology Association).|[25]|\n|\n|3GPP|[|edit|]|\n|3GPP| started standardization work of cellular V2X (C-V2X) in Release 14 in 2014. It is based on LTE as the underlying technology. Specifications were published in 2017. Because this C-V2X functionalities are based on LTE, it is often referred to as LTE-V2X. The scope of functionalities supported by C-V2X includes both direct communication (V2V, V2I) as well as wide area cellular network communication (V2N).\n|In Release 15, 3GPP continued its C-V2X standardization to be based on 5G.  Specifications are published in 2018 as Release 15 comes to completion. To indicate the underlying technology, the term 5G-V2X is often used in contrast to LTE-based V2X (LTE-V2X).  Either case, C-V2X is the generic terminology that refers to the V2X technology using the cellular technology irrespective of the specific generation of technology.\n|In Release 16, 3GPP further enhances the C-V2X functionality. The work is currently in progress. In this way, C-V2X is inherently future-proof by supporting migration path to 5G.\n|Study and analysis were done|[4]|[5]| to compare the effectiveness of direct communication technologies between LTE-V2X PC5 and 802.11p from the perspective of accident avoided and reduction in fatal and serious injuries. The study shows that LTE-V2X achieves higher level of accident avoidance and reduction in injury.|[4]| It also indicates LTE-V2X performs higher percentage of successful packet delivery and communication range. Another link-level and system-level simulation result indicates that, to achieve the same link performance for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) are achievable by LTE-V2X PC5 interface compared to IEEE 802.11p.|[5]|\n|Cellular-based V2X solution also leads to the possibility of further protecting other types of road users (e.g. pedestrian, cyclist) by having PC5 interface to be integrated into smartphones, effectively integrating those road users into the overall C-ITS solution.  Vehicle-to-person (V2P) includes Vulnerable Road User (VRU) scenarios to detect pedestrians and cyclists to avoid accident and injuries involving those road users.\n|As both direct communication and wide area cellular network communication are defined in the same standard (3GPP), both modes of communication will likely be integrated into a single chipset.  Commercialization of those chipsets further enhances economy of scale and leads to possibilities to wider range of business models and services using both types of communications.\n|\n|Regulatory history|[|edit|]|\n|United States|[|edit|]|\n|In 1999 the US |Federal Communications Commission| (FCC) allocated 75\xa0MHz in the spectrum of 5.850-5.925\xa0GHz for intelligent transport systems.|[26]|\n|Since then the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) has been working with a range of stakeholders on V2X. In 2012 a pre-deployment project was implemented in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 2800 vehicles covering cars, motorcycles, buses and HGV of different brands took part using equipment by different manufacturers.|[27]| The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) saw this model deployment as proof that road safety could be improved and that WAVE standard technology was interoperable. In August 2014 NHTSA published a report arguing vehicle-to-vehicle technology was technically proven as ready for deployment.|[15]| On 20 August 2014 the NHTSA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register,|[28]| arguing that the safety benefits of V2X communication could only be achieved if a significant part of the vehicles fleet was equipped. Because of the lack of an immediate benefit for early adopters, the NHTSA proposed a mandatory introduction. On 25 June 2015 the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the matter,|[29]| where again the NHTSA, as well as other stakeholders argued the case for V2X.|[30]|\n|On November 18, 2020, the FCC reallocated 45 MHz in the 5.850–5.895\xa0GHz range to |Wi-Fi|, and the rest of the V2X band to C-V2X, citing the failure of DSRC to take off.|[31]| The advocacy organizations |ITS America| and |American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials| sued the FCC, arguing that the decision harms users of DSRC; on August 12, 2022, a federal court permitted the reassignment to go ahead.|[32]|\n|\n|Europe|[|edit|]|\n|To acquire EU-wide spectrum, radio applications require a harmonised standard, in case of ITS-G5 ETSI EN 302 571,|[33]| first published in 2008. A harmonised standard in turn requires an ETSI System Reference Document, here ETSI TR 101 788.|[34]| Commission Decision 2008/671/EC harmonises the use of the 5 875-5 905\xa0MHz frequency band for transport safety ITS applications.|[35]| In 2010 the ITS Directive 2010/40/EU|[36]| was adopted. It aims to assure that ITS applications are interoperable and can operate across national borders, it defines priority areas for secondary legislation, which cover V2X and requires technologies to be mature. In 2014 the European Commission\'s industry stakeholder “C-ITS Deployment Platform” started working on a regulatory framework for V2X in the EU.|[37]| It identified key approaches to an EU-wide V2X security Public Key infrastructure (PKI) and data protection, as well as facilitating a mitigation standard|[38]| to prevent radio interference between ITS-G5 based V2X and road charging systems. The European Commission recognised ITS-G5 as the initial communication technology in its 5G Action Plan|[39]| and the accompanying explanatory document,|[40]| to form a communication environment consisting of ITS-G5 and cellular communication as envisioned by EU Member States.|[41]| Various pre-deployment projects exist at EU or EU Member State level, such as SCOOP@F, the Testfeld Telematik, the digital testbed Autobahn, the Rotterdam-Vienna ITS Corridor, Nordic Way, COMPASS4D or C-ROADS.|[42]| There exist real scenarios of implementation V2X standard as well. The first commercial project where V2X standard is used for Intersection movement assist use-case. It has been realized in |Brno| City / |Czech Republic| where 80 pcs of cross intersections are controlled by V2X communication standard from public transport vehicles of municipality Brno.|[43]|\n|\n|Spectrum allocation|[|edit|]|\n|Spectrum allocation for C-ITS in various countries is shown in the following table. Due to the standardization of V2X in 802.11p preceding C-V2X standardization in |3GPP|, spectrum allocation was originally intended for the 802.11p based system. However, the regulations are technology neutral so that the deployment of C-V2X is not excluded.\n|In 2022, US Federal Courts told the FCC that it could reallocate 45MHz of V2X spectrum to wireless and cellular carriers, citing years of no use by V2X constituents.\n|\n|\n|\n|Country|\n|Spectrum (MHz)|\n|Allocated bandwidth (MHz)\n|\n|\n|Australia|\n|5855 – 5925|\n|70\n|\n|\n|China|\n|5905 - 5925 (trials)|\n|20\n|\n|\n|Europe|\n|5875 – 5905|\n|30\n|\n|\n|Japan|\n|755.5-764.5 and 5770 – 5850|\n|9 and 80\n|\n|\n|Korea|\n|5855 – 5925|\n|70\n|\n|\n|Singapore|\n|5875 – 5925|\n|50\n|\n|\n|USA|\n|5895 - 5925|\n|30\n|\n|Consideration in the transition period|[|edit|]|\n|The deployment of V2X technology (either C-V2X or 802.11p based products) will occur gradually over time. New cars will be equipped with either of the two technologies starting around 2020 and its proportion on the road is expected to increase gradually. The Volkswagen Golf 8th generation was the first passenger car to be fitted with V2X technology powered by NXP technology.|[44]| In the meantime, existing (legacy) vehicles will continue to exist on the road. This implies that the V2X capable vehicles will need to co-exist with non-V2X (legacy) vehicles or with V2X vehicles of incompatible technology.\n|The main obstacles to its adoption are legal issues and the fact that, unless almost all vehicles adopt it, its effectiveness is limited.|[45]| British weekly "The Economist" argues that autonomous driving is more driven by regulations than by technology.|[46]|\n|However, more recent study|[4]|  indicates that there are benefits in reducing traffic accidents even during the transitional period in which the technology is being adopted in the market.\n|\n|Further reading|[|edit|]|\n|Many books and papers have been written in the topic:\n|\n|Toward Reliable and Scalable Internet-of-Vehicles: Performance Analysis and Resource Management. |[47]|\n|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Vehicular communication systems|\n|IEEE 802.11p|\n|Cellular V2X|\n|V2V|\n|V2G|\n|V2D|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |"Vehicle-To-Vehicle Communication Technology For Light Vehicles"| |(PDF)|. |www.google.com|. p.\xa0e10|.

It differs from traditional car rental in that the owners of the cars are often private individuals themselves, and the carsharing facilitator is generally distinct from the car owner. Carsharing is part of a larger trend of |shared mobility|.\n|Carsharing enables an occasional use of a vehicle or access to different brands of vehicles. The renting organization may be a commercial business. Users can also organize as a |company|, public agency, |cooperative|, or |ad hoc| grouping. The network of cars on the network becomes available to the users through a variety of means, ranging from the simplicity of using an app to unlock the car in real time, to meeting the owner of the car in order to exchange keys. As of January 2020 the world\'s top city for car sharing is |Moscow with more than 30,000 vehicles|[1]| (though in Moscow almost all carsharing cars are owned by large facilitators).\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |History|\n|\n|1.1| |Early days|\n|1.2| |Boom in the United States|\n|1.3| |Development and growth|\n|1.4| |Global development and comparison in urban regions|\n|\n|\n|2| |Types of carsharing|\n|\n|2.1| |Round-trip carsharing|\n|2.2| |One-way/free-floating carsharing|\n|2.3| |By conventional companies|\n|2.4| |Peer-to-peer carsharing|\n|2.5| |Fractional ownership|\n|\n|\n|3| |Difference from traditional car rentals|\n|4| |Technology|\n|5| |International terminology|\n|6| |See also|\n|7| |References|\n|8| |External links|\n|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|Early days|[|edit|]|\n|The first reference to carsharing in print identifies the |Selbstfahrergenossenschaft| carshare program in a |housing cooperative| that got underway in |Zürich| in 1948,|[2]|[3]| but there was no known formal development of the concept in the next few years. By the 1960s, as innovators, industrialists, cities, and public authorities studied the possibility of high-technology transportation – mainly computer-based small vehicle systems (almost all of them on separate guideways) – it was possible to spot some early precursors to present-day service ideas and control technologies.\n|The early 1970s saw the first whole-system carshare projects. The ProcoTip system in France lasted only about two years. A much more ambitious project called the |Witkar| was launched in Amsterdam by the founders of the 1965 |white bicycles| project. A sophisticated project based on small electric vehicles, electronic controls for reservations and return, and plans for a large number of stations covering the entire city, the project endured into the mid-1980s before finally being abandoned.\n|In July 1977, the first official British experiment in carsharing started in Suffolk. An office in Ipswich provided a |Share-a-Car| service for "putting motorists who are interested in sharing car journeys in touch with each other."|[4]| In 1978, the |Agricultural Research Council| granted the |University of Leeds| £16,577 "for an investigation and simulation of carsharing".|[5]| The scheme was not intended for different drivers of a single car but for a driver offering seats in his car.\n|The 1980s and first half of the 1990s was a "|coming of age|" period for carsharing, with continued slow growth, mainly of smaller non-profit systems, many in Switzerland and Germany|[6]| but also on a smaller scale in Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States.|[7]|\n|Carsharing in North America was founded in Quebec City in 1994 by Benoît Robert, with a company called Communauto that is still a leader in carsharing globally. Cycling advocate and environmentalist Claire Morissette (1950–2007) played a major role in its evolution starting in 1995, when Communauto established itself in Montreal as a private company. The company goal is to provide a convenient and economical alternative to owning a car.\n|In 2005, a novel form of car sharing service, the "Libre Service Integral", later known as Free Floating, has been introduce by VULOG and tested from 2007 in Antibes CiteVU mobility service, on the French riviera. An electric car paid by minute, when and how long I need, where I want and where I go". This service was added to Communauto in 2012.\n|\n|Boom in the United States|[|edit|]|\n| |Carsharing growth in the United States|\n|The first car-sharing company in the U.S. was CarSharing Portland, founded by Dave Brook in March by 1998 after a visit from Conrad Wagner of Mobility Switzerland. Conrad and Dave would also help establish |Flexcar| in Seattle, which launched in 2000, the same year as competitor Zipcar on the east coast. In April 2001 Carsharing Portland, then with 25 vehicles, merged with Flexcar, as its first expansion city. |[8]|[9]| |Zipcar|, (merged with Zipcar in 2007), and |City Car Club| were all started in 2000. |City CarShare| was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2001, as a non-profit. Several |car rental| companies launched their own carsharing services beginning in 2008, including Avis on Location by |Avis|, |Hertz on Demand| (formerly known as |Connect by Hertz|[10]|), operating in the U.S. and Europe; |Uhaul Car Share| owned by |U-Haul|, and |WeCar| by |Enterprise Rent-A-Car|.|[11]| By 2010, when various |peer-to-peer carsharing| systems were introduced. As of September\xa02012|[update]|[12]| Zipcar accounted for 80% of the U.S carsharing market|[11]|[13]| and half of all car-sharers worldwide|[14]| with 730,000 members sharing 11,000 vehicles.\n|In 2008, City CarShare introduced the first wheelchair carrying car share vehicle, the |Access Mobile|, specifically designed as a fleet vehicle shared with non-wheelchair users.\n|Carsharing is noted as a tool for achieving vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in the California Transport Plan (CTP) 2040 to reduce congestion and pollution.|[15]|\n|\n|Development and growth|[|edit|]|\n|\n|World cities by carshare fleet in 2018|[16]|\n|\n|\n|city\n|\n|fleet in units\n|\n|\n|Tokyo|\n|\n|19.800|\n|\n|\n|Moscow|\n|\n|16.500|\n|\n|\n|Beijing|\n|\n|15.400|\n|\n|\n|Shanghai|\n|\n|13.900|\n|\n|\n|Guangzhou|\n|\n|4.200|\n|\n|\n|Carsharing has also spread to other global markets with dense urban populations (such as Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey) given that population density is often a critical determinant of success for carsharing.|[17]| Successful carsharing development has tended to be associated mainly with densely populated areas, such as city centers and more recently university and other campuses. There are some programs (mostly in Europe) for providing services in lower density and rural areas.|[|citation needed|]| Low-density areas are considered more difficult to serve with carsharing because of the lack of alternative modes of transportation and the potentially larger distance that users must travel to reach the cars.\n|Many building developers are now incorporating share-cars into their developments as an added value to tenants, and municipal government bodies around the world are starting to stipulate the implementation of a carsharing service in new buildings, as a sustainability initiative. These trends have created a demand for a new model of carsharing – residential, private-access share-cars that are typically underwritten by the |Homeowner association|.|[|citation needed|]| In Germany a pilot project has been started by the semiconductor manufacturer |Infineon| to replace regular pool vehicles with a corporate carsharing system.|[18]| Replacing private automobiles with shared ones directly reduces demand for parking spaces. The fact that only a certain number of cars can be in use at any one time may reduce |traffic congestion| at |peak times|. Even more important for congestion, the strong metering of costs provides a cost incentive to drive less. With owned automobiles many expenses are |sunk costs| and thus independent of how much the car is driven (such as original purchase, insurance, registration, and some maintenance).\n|According to |Navigant Consulting|, global carsharing services revenue is expected to grow to |US$6.2| billion by 2020, with over 12 million members worldwide. The main factors driving the growth of carsharing are the rising levels of congestion faced by city dwellers; shifting generational mindsets about car ownership; the increasing costs of personal vehicle ownership; and a convergence of business models.|[19]|[20]| Carsharing operators increasingly opt to brand parts of their fleets with third-party advertising in order to increase revenue and improve competitiveness (|Transit media|).\n|For future applications, many carsharing companies invest in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (|PHEV|) to reduce petroleum consumption. One idea is to calculate and compensate all emissions on behalf of your drivers according to the Kyoto protocol, e.g. via reforestation schemes. The world\'s first certified |carbon neutral| carsharing service is Respiro carsharing in Madrid|[21]| and is also done by Australian p2p car sharing platform |Car Next Door|.\n|The most important technological innovation to affect the carsharing market is self-driving cars. It is expected that most self-driving vehicles won\'t be owned by individuals, but will rather be shared. Some companies, like |Ernst & Young|, have also started to use blockchain technology to record ownership, usage of shared vehicles and insurance information.|[22]|\n|In July 2018, |Volkswagen| announced its intention to launch an all-electric car-sharing service by 2019.|[23]| In August 2018, the carsharing startup |Getaround| rose $300 million from |Softbank|.|[24]| According to Moscow\'s authority, the number of carsharing journeys in the city averaged 30,000 a day between January and September 2018.|[25]|\n|\n|Global development and comparison in urban regions|[|edit|]|\n|Car-sharing is growing in urban regions as more people around the world adopt it.|[26]| The world\'s top cities for car-sharing in 2018 were\n|Tokyo| (|Japan|) with 19.8K vehicles, |Moscow| (|Russia|) with 16.5K vehicles, |Beijing| (|China|) with 15.4K vehicles, |Shanghai| (China) with 13.9K vehicles, |Guangzhou| (China) with 4.2K vehicles.|[27]|\n|\n|Types of carsharing|[|edit|]|\n|Generally, carsharing programs fall into one of four sharing models: round-trip, one-way, peer-to-peer, or fractional.\n|\n|Round-trip carsharing|[|edit|]|\n|Members begin and end their trip at the same location, often paying by the hour, mile, or both.\n|\n|One-way/free-floating carsharing|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |One-way carsharing|\n|One-way carsharing enables users to begin and end their trip at different locations through free floating zones or station-based models with designated parking locations.|[28]| As of 2017, free-floating carsharing is available in 55 cities and 20 countries worldwide, with 40,000 vehicles and serving 5.6 million users, with |Europe| and |North America| representing the majority of the market. In Europe, free floating services took up more than 65 percent in carsharing membership.|[29]|\n|The service is expected to reach 14.3 million users with more than 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2022.|[30]|\n|\n|By conventional companies|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Company car|\n|In |corporate car sharing|, the company shares the vehicles and allows multiple employees (rather than just one) to make use of a company car, at times when they actually need it. The vehicles are made available from a |corporate car sharing pool|, and shared for a fixed or flexible period of time.|[31]| One shared car could replace up to 8 non-shared cars. However, car-sharing does involves an additional processing and associated costs.|[32]| Still, it  reduces fleet-related costs over the long term and allow employees to save not only on costs but also on time.|[33]|[|clarification needed|]|\n|\n|Peer-to-peer carsharing|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Peer-to-peer carsharing|\n|Peer-to-peer carsharing, sometimes referred to as P2P or Personal Vehicle Sharing,|[28]| operates similarly to round-trip carsharing in trip and payment type. However, the vehicles themselves are typically privately owned or leased with the sharing system operated by a third-party.\n|\n|Fractional ownership|[|edit|]|\n|Fractional ownership allows users to co-own a vehicle and share its costs and use.|[34]|\nNeighborhood fractional ownership carsharing is often promoted as an alternative to owning a car where |public transit|, walking, and |cycling| can be used most of the time and a car is only necessary for out-of-town trips, moving large items, or special occasions. It can also be an alternative to owning multiple cars for households with more than one driver.|[35]|\n|\n|Difference from traditional car rentals|[|edit|]|\n|Carsharing differs from traditional car rentals in the following ways:\n|\n|Carsharing is not limited by office hours|\n|Reservation, pickup, and return is all self-service|\n|Vehicles can be rented by the minute, by the hour, as well as by the day|\n|Users are members and have been pre-approved to drive (background driving checks have been performed and a payment mechanism has been established).|\n|Vehicle locations are distributed throughout the service area, and often located for access by |public transport|.|\n|Insurance: (this section is US specific) state minimum liability insurance (only $5000 in some states), comprehensive and collision insurance. They do not provide uninsured, under-insured or personal injury protection insurance.|\n|Fuel costs are included in the rates.|\n|Vehicles are not serviced (cleaning, fueling) after each use, although certain programs (such as |Car2Go| or |GoGet|) continuously clean and fuel their fleet.|\n|With carsharing, individuals have access to private cars without having costs and responsibilities associated with car ownership (except for fractional ownerships).|[36]| Some carshare operations (CSOs) cooperate with local car rental firms, in particular in situations wherein classic rental may be the cheaper option.\n|The insurance policies on carsharing greatly varies among companies, but all carsharing firms provide insurance that at least meets the legal minimum requirements for the given region of operation.|[|citation needed|]| Rob Lieber of |The New York Times| has criticized carsharing firms such as Zipcar for the paltry coverage afforded carsharing drivers.|[37]|\n|\n|Technology|[|edit|]|\n| |Yandex.Drive|, the largest car sharing operator in Russia, uses mobile tankers to refuel its vehicle fleet. The company claims that specific cars for refueling are chosen by special algorithm as well as the most optimal routes to them.|[38]|\n|The technology of CSOs varies enormously, from simple manual systems using key boxes and log books to increasingly complex computer-based systems (e.g. partially automated and fully automated systems) with supporting |software packages| that handle a growing array of back office functions.|[39]| The simplest CSOs have only one or two pick-up points, but more advanced systems allow cars to be picked up and dropped off at any available public parking space within a designated operating area.\n|Once the reservations are completed and confirmed, the car will then be delivered at the time and place scheduled. There will be a small card reader mounted on the windshield. Once the customer places their membership card on the reader, it will use what is called |blink technology| to activate the time and unlock the car. The reader will not work until it is time for that specific reservation. The keys can then be found somewhere inside the car such as the glove compartment. Depending on the company, the customer may be provided with a key to a lock box that contains the ignition key itself.|[40]| In some cases the car can be unlocked using a mobile phone and the car can even be started using the phone as well.\n|Many car sharing networks price their services as a small start up fee and then a mileage fee for the distance driven in the car. Usually the app will include insurance, gas cards, and upkeep to their fleet of cars at no additional charge to the customer.\n|\n|International terminology|[|edit|]|\n|\xa0|United Kingdom|: "car clubs".|[41]| In the UK, "car sharing" refers to what is called "|carpooling|" or "|ride sharing|" in the US, namely the shared use of a car for a specific journey, in particular for commuting to work, often by people who each have a car but travel together to save costs.|[42]|\n|\xa0|South Africa|: "|lift scheme|".|\n|\xa0|India|: "self-drive."|[43]|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Sharing economy|\n|Alternatives to car use|\n|Car rental|\n|Carpool|\n|Ecoleasing|\n|Fleet vehicle|\n|List of carsharing organizations|\n|Ridesharing company|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |Москва вышла в мировые лидеры по парку каршеринга|\n|\n|^| |"The CarSharing Handbook (Part 1)"|.

Typically |lithium-ion batteries|, they are specifically designed for high |electric charge| (or energy) capacity.\n|Electric vehicle batteries differ from |starting, lighting, and ignition| (SLI) batteries as they are designed to give power over sustained periods of time and are |deep-cycle batteries|. Batteries for electric vehicles are characterized by their relatively high |power-to-weight ratio|, |specific energy| and |energy density|; smaller, lighter batteries are desirable because they reduce the weight of the vehicle and therefore improve its performance. Compared to liquid fuels, most current battery technologies have much lower |specific energy|, and this often impacts the maximum all-electric range of the vehicles.\n|The most common battery type in modern |electric vehicles| are lithium-ion and |lithium polymer|, because of their high energy density compared to their weight.  Other types of rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles include |lead–acid| ("flooded", deep-cycle, and |valve regulated lead acid|), |nickel-cadmium|, |nickel–metal hydride|, and, less commonly, |zinc–air|, and |sodium nickel chloride ("zebra")| batteries.|[1]| The amount of electricity (i.e. electric charge) stored in batteries is measured in |ampere hours| or in |coulombs|, with the total energy often measured in |kilowatt-hours| (kWh).\n|Since the late 1990s, advances in lithium-ion battery technology have been driven by demands from portable electronics, laptop computers, mobile phones, and power tools. The BEV and HEV marketplace has reaped the benefits of these advances both in performance and energy density. Unlike earlier battery chemistries, notably |nickel-cadmium|, lithium-ion batteries can be discharged and recharged daily and at any state of charge.\n|The battery pack makes up a significant cost of a BEV or a HEV. As of December\xa02019|[update]|, the cost of electric vehicle batteries has fallen 87% since 2010 on a per kilowatt-hour basis.|[2]| As of 2018, vehicles with over 250\xa0mi (400\xa0km) of all-electric range, such as the |Tesla Model S|, have been commercialized and are now available in numerous vehicle segments.|[3]|\n|In terms of operating costs, the price of electricity to run a BEV is a small fraction of the cost of fuel for equivalent internal combustion engines, reflecting higher |energy efficiency|.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Electric vehicle battery types|\n|\n|1.1| |Lead-acid|\n|1.2| |Nickel-metal hydride|\n|1.3| |Zebra|\n|1.4| |Lithium-ion|\n|1.5| |Battery capacity|\n|\n|\n|2| |Battery cost|\n|3| |EV parity|\n|\n|3.1| |Cost parity|\n|3.2| |Range parity|\n|\n|\n|4| |Specifics|\n|\n|4.1| |Internal components|\n|4.2| |Recharging|\n|\n|4.2.1| |Recharging time|\n|4.2.2| |Connectors|\n|4.2.3| |Recharging spots|\n|4.2.4| |Travel range before recharging|\n|4.2.5| |Trailers|\n|4.2.6| |Swapping and removing|\n|4.2.7| |Re-filling|\n|\n|\n|4.3| |Lifecycle of lithium-based EV batteries|\n|\n|4.3.1| |Manufacturing|\n|\n|4.3.1.1| |Reusing and repurposing|\n|4.3.1.2| |Recycling|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|4.4| |Environmental impact|\n|4.5| |Vehicle-to-grid|\n|4.6| |Safety|\n|4.7| |Patents|\n|\n|\n|5| |Research, development and innovation|\n|\n|5.1| |Ultracapacitors|\n|5.2| |Promotion in the United States|\n|5.3| |Promotion in Norway|\n|\n|\n|6| |See also|\n|\n|6.1| |Examples|\n|6.2| |Related|\n|\n|\n|7| |References|\n|8| |External links|\n|\n|\n|Electric vehicle battery types|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |rechargeable battery|\n| |Old: Banks of conventional lead-acid car batteries are still used for propulsion of some BEVs.|\n| |Cylindrical cell (18650) prior to assembly|\n| |Lithium ion battery| monitoring electronics (over- and discharge protection)|\n|Lead-acid|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Lead–acid battery|\n|Flooded lead-acid batteries are the oldest, cheapest, and, in the past, most common vehicle batteries available. There are two main types of lead-acid batteries: automobile engine starter batteries, and deep cycle batteries. Automobile engine starter batteries are designed to use a small percentage of their capacity to provide high charge rates to start the engine, while deep cycle batteries are used to provide continuous electricity to run electric vehicles like forklifts or golf carts. Deep cycle batteries are also used as the auxiliary batteries in recreational vehicles, but they require different, multi-stage charging.|[4]| No lead acid battery should be discharged below 50% of its capacity, as it shortens the battery\'s life.|[4]| Flooded batteries require inspection of electrolyte levels and occasional replacement of water, which gases away during the normal charging cycle.\n|Previously, most electric vehicles used lead-acid batteries due to their mature technology, high availability, and low cost, with the notable exception of some early BEVs, such as the |Detroit Electric| which used a |nickel–iron battery|. Deep-cycle lead batteries are expensive and have a shorter life than the vehicle itself, typically needing replacement every 3\xa0years.\n|Lead-acid batteries in EV applications end up being a significant (25–50%) portion of the final vehicle mass. Like all batteries, they have significantly lower specific energy than petroleum fuels—in this case, 30–50\xa0W⋅h/kg. While the difference isn\'t as extreme as it first appears due to the lighter drive-train in an EV, even the best batteries tend to lead to higher masses when applied to vehicles with a normal range. The efficiency (70–75%) and storage capacity of the current generation of common deep cycle lead acid batteries decreases with lower temperatures, and diverting power to run a heating coil reduces efficiency and range by up to 40%.|[|citation needed|]|\n|Charging and operation of batteries typically results in the emission of |hydrogen|, |oxygen| and |sulfur|, which are naturally occurring and normally harmless if properly vented. Early |Citicar| owners discovered that, if not vented properly, unpleasant sulfur smells would leak into the cabin immediately after charging.\n|Lead-acid batteries powered such early modern EVs as the original versions of the |EV1|.\n|\n|Nickel-metal hydride|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Nickel–metal hydride battery|\n| |GM Ovonic NiMH battery module|\n|Nickel-metal hydride batteries are now considered a relatively |mature technology|.|[5]| While less efficient (60–70%) in charging and discharging than even lead-acid, they have a specific energy of 30–80\xa0W⋅h/kg, far higher than lead-acid. When used properly, nickel-metal hydride batteries can have exceptionally long lives, as has been demonstrated in their use in |hybrid cars| and in the surviving first-generation NiMH |Toyota RAV4\xa0EVs| that still operate well after 100,000 miles (160,000\xa0km) and over a decade of service. Downsides include the poor efficiency, high self-discharge, very finicky charge cycles, and poor performance in cold weather.\n|GM Ovonic produced the NiMH battery used in the second generation EV-1, and Cobasys makes a nearly identical battery (ten 1.2\xa0V 85\xa0A⋅h NiMH cells in series in contrast with eleven cells for Ovonic battery). This worked very well in the EV-1.|[6]| |Patent encumbrance| has limited the use of these batteries in recent years.\n|\n|Zebra|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Molten salt battery|\n|The sodium nickel chloride or "Zebra" battery uses a molten |sodium chloroaluminate| (NaAlCl|4|) salt as the electrolyte. A relatively mature technology, the Zebra battery has a specific energy of 120\xa0W⋅h/kg. Since the battery must be heated for use, cold weather does not strongly affect its operation except for increasing heating costs. They have been used in several EVs such as the |Modec| |commercial vehicle|.|[7]| Zebra batteries can last for a few thousand charge cycles and are nontoxic. The downsides to the Zebra battery include poor specific power (<300\xa0W/kg) and the requirement of having to heat the electrolyte to about 270\xa0°C (518\xa0°F), which wastes some energy, presents difficulties in long-term storage of charge, and is potentially a hazard.\n|\n|Lithium-ion|[|edit|]|\n|Main articles: |Lithium-ion battery| and |Lithium polymer battery|\n| |A man cutting open a lithium-ion battery for use in an |electric vehicle|\n|lithium-ion (and the mechanistically similar lithium polymer) batteries, were initially developed and commercialized for use in laptops and consumer electronics. With their high energy density and long cycle life they have become the leading battery type for use in EVs. The first commercialized lithium-ion chemistry was a lithium cobalt oxide |cathode| and a graphite |anode| first demonstrated by N. Godshall in 1979, and by |John Goodenough|, and |Akira Yoshino| shortly thereafter.|[8]|[9]|[10]|[11]| The downside of traditional lithium-ion batteries include sensitivity to temperature, low temperature power performance, and performance degradation with age.|[12]| Due to the volatility of organic electrolytes, the presence of highly oxidized metal oxides, and the thermal instability of the anode SEI layer, traditional lithium-ion batteries pose a fire safety risk if punctured or charged improperly.|[13]| These early cells did not accept or supply charge when extremely cold, and so heaters can be necessary in some climates to warm them. The maturity of this technology is moderate. The |Tesla Roadster (2008)| and other cars produced by the company used a modified form of traditional lithium-ion "laptop battery" cells.\n|Recent EVs are using new variations on lithium-ion chemistry that sacrifice specific energy and specific power to provide fire resistance, environmental friendliness, rapid charging (as quickly as a few minutes), and longer lifespans. These variants (phosphates, titanates, spinels, etc.) have been shown to have a much longer lifetime, with |A123| types using |lithium iron phosphate| lasting at least more than 10 years and more than 7000 charge/discharge cycles,|[14]| and LG Chem expecting their |lithium-manganese spinel| batteries to last up to 40\xa0years.|[|citation needed|]|\n|Much work is being done on lithium-ion batteries in the lab.|[15]| Lithium vanadium oxide has already made its way into the |Subaru| prototype |G4e|, doubling energy density.|[|citation needed|]| Silicon nanowires,|[16]|[17]| silicon nanoparticles,|[18]| and tin nanoparticles|[19]|[20]| promise several times the energy density|[|clarification needed|]| in the anode, while composite|[21]|[22]| and superlattice|[23]| cathodes also promise significant density improvements.\n|New data has shown that exposure to heat and the use of fast charging promote the degradation of Li-ion batteries more than age and actual use, and that the average electric vehicle battery will retain 90% of its initial capacity after six years and six months of service. For example, the battery in a |Nissan Leaf| will degrade twice as fast as the battery in a Tesla, because the Leaf does not have an active cooling system for its battery.|[24]|\n|\n|Battery capacity|[|edit|]|\n|Non–plug-in hybrid cars have battery capacities between 0.65\xa0kW⋅h (2012 |Honda Civic Hybrid|) and 1.8\xa0kW⋅h (2001 |Toyota Prius|).\n|Plug-in hybrid cars have battery capacities between 4.4\xa0kW⋅h (2012 |Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid|) and 40.6 \xa0kW⋅h (|Li Auto One|).\n|All-electric cars have battery capacities between 6.0\xa0kW⋅h (2012 |Renault Twizy|) and 212.7\xa0kW⋅h (2022 |GMC Hummer EV|[25]|).\n|\n|Battery cost|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |rechargeable battery §\xa0Price history|\n| |Learning curve| of lithium-ion batteries: the price of batteries declined by 97% in three decades.|[26]|[27]|\n| |Prototypes of 50\xa0W⋅h/kg |lithium-ion-polymer battery|. Newer Li-ion cells can provide up to 265\xa0W⋅h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles.|\n|In 2010, scientists at the |Technical University of Denmark| paid US$10,000 for a certified EV battery with 25\xa0kWh capacity (i.e. US$400/kWh), with no rebates or surcharges.|[28]| Two out of 15 battery producers could supply the necessary technical documents about quality and fire safety.|[29]| In 2010 it was estimated that at most 10\xa0years would pass before the battery price would come down to one-third.|[28]|\n|According to a 2010 study, by the |United States National Research Council|, the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack was about |US$1,700|/|kWh| of usable energy, and considering that a |PHEV|-10 requires about 2.0\xa0kWh and a PHEV-40 about 8\xa0kWh, the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a PHEV-10 is around |US$3,000| and it goes up to |US$14,000| for a PHEV-40.|[30]|[31]| The |MIT Technology Review| estimated the cost of automotive battery packs to be between |US$225| to |US$500| per kilowatt hour by 2020.|[32]| A 2013 study by the |American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy| reported that battery costs came down from |US$1,300|/kWh in 2007 to |US$500|/kWh in 2012. The |U.S. Department of Energy| has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of |US$300|/kWh in 2015 and |US$125|/kWh by 2022. Cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.|[33]| In 2016, the world had a Li-ion production capacity of 41.57\xa0GW⋅h.|[34]|\n|The actual costs for cells are subject to much debate and speculation as most EV manufacturers refuse to discuss this topic in detail. However, in October 2015, car maker GM revealed at their annual Global Business Conference that they expected a price of |US$145|/kWh for Li-ion cells entering 2016, substantially lower than other analysts\' cost estimates. GM also expects a cost of |US$100|/kWh by the end of 2021.|[35]|\n|According to a study published in February 2016 by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), battery prices fell 65% since 2010, and 35% just in 2015, reaching |US$350|/kWh. The study concludes that battery costs are on a trajectory to make electric vehicles without |government subsidies| as affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by 2022. BNEF projects that by 2040, long-range electric cars will cost less than |US$22,000| expressed in 2016 dollars. BNEF expects electric car battery costs to be well below |US$120|/kWh by 2030, and to fall further thereafter as new chemistries become available.|[36]|[37]|\n|\n|Battery cost estimate comparison|\n|\n|\n|Battery type|\n|Year|\n|Cost (US$/kWh)\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2021|\n|132|[38]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2016|\n|130|[39]|-145|[35]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2014|\n|200–300|[40]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|500–600|[41]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|400|[42]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|520–650|[43]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|752|[43]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|689|[43]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2013|\n|800–1000|[44]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2010|\n|750|[45]|\n|\n|\n|Nickel–metal hydride|\n|2004|\n|750|[46]|\n|\n|\n|Nickel–metal hydride|\n|2013|\n|500–550|[44]|\n|\n|\n|Nickel–metal hydride|\n|\n|350|[47]|\n|\n|\n|Lead–acid|\n|\n|256.68\n|\n|EV parity|[|edit|]|\n|In 2010, battery professor Poul Norby stated that he believed that lithium batteries will need to double their specific energy and bring down the price from US$500 (2010) to US$100 per |kWh| capacity in order to make an impact on petrol cars.|[48]| |Citigroup| indicates US$230/kWh.\n|Toyota Prius 2012 plug-in\'s official page declare 21 kilometres (13\xa0mi) of range and a battery capacity of 5.2\xa0kWh with a ratio of 4 kilometres (2.5\xa0mi)/kWh, while the Addax (2015 model) utility vehicle already reaches 110 kilometres (68.5\xa0mi) or a ratio of 7.5 kilometers (4.6\xa0mi)/kWh.|[49]|\n|Battery electric cars have an |energy consumption| between 2.5 miles (4.0\xa0km)/kWh (85 |MPGe|) and 5.0 miles (8.0\xa0km)/kWh (135 MPGe).\n|United States Secretary of Energy| |Steven Chu| predicted costs for a 40-mile range battery will drop from a price in 2008 of US$12,000 to US$3,600 in 2015 and further to US$1,500 by 2020.|[50]|[51]| lithium-ion, Li-poly, |Aluminium-air batteries| and |zinc-air batteries| have demonstrated specific energies high enough to deliver range and recharge times comparable to conventional fossil fueled vehicles.\n|\n|Cost parity|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Electric vehicle conversion|\n|Different costs are important. One issue is purchase price, the other issue is total cost of ownership. As of 2015, electric cars are more expensive to initially purchase, but cheaper to run, and in at least some cases, total cost of ownership may be lower.\n|According to |Kammen et al., 2008|, new PEVs would become cost efficient to consumers if battery prices would decrease from US$1300/kWh to about US$500/kWh (so that the battery may pay for itself).|[52]|\n|In 2010, the |Nissan Leaf| battery pack was reportedly produced at a cost of US$18,000.|[53]| Nissan\'s initial production costs at the launch of the Leaf were therefore about US$750 per kilowatt hour (for the 24\xa0kWh battery).|[53]|\n|In 2012, |McKinsey Quarterly| linked battery prices to gasoline prices on a basis of 5-year |total cost of ownership| for a car, estimating that US$3.50/gallon equates to US$250/kWh.|[54]| In 2017 |McKinsey| estimated that electric cars will be competitive at a battery pack cost of US$100/kWh (expected around 2030), and expects pack costs to be US$190/kWh by 2020.|[55]|\n|In October 2015, car maker GM revealed at their annual Global Business Conference that they expected a price of US$145 per kilowatt hour for Li-ion cells entering 2016.|[35]|\n|\n|Range parity|[|edit|]|\n|Driving range parity means that the electric vehicle has the same range as an average all-combustion vehicle (500 kilometres or 310 miles), with batteries of specific energy greater than 1\xa0|kWh/kg|.|[56]| Higher range means that the electric vehicles would run more kilometers without recharge. Currently, electric vehicle sales are lower than expected due range anxiety - even with the same range as an average all-combustion vehicle, buyers must be assured that there are widely available and compatible charging stations for their vehicles, which are currently not as common as gas stations.|[57]|\n|Japanese and European Union officials are in talks to jointly develop advanced rechargeable batteries for electric cars to help nations reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Developing a battery that can power an electric vehicle 500 kilometres (310\xa0mi) on a single charging is feasible, said Japanese |battery maker| |GS Yuasa| Corp. |Sharp Corp| and GS Yuasa are among Japanese solar-power cell and battery makers that may benefit from cooperation.|[58]|\n|\n|The lithium-ion battery in the |AC Propulsion tzero| provides 400 to 500\xa0km (200 to 300\xa0mi) of range per charge (single charge range).|[59]| The list price of this vehicle when it was released in 2003 was US$220,000.|[60]|\n|Driving in a |Daihatsu Mira| equipped with 74\xa0|kWh| lithium ion batteries, the |Japan EV Club| has achieved a world record for an electric car: 1,003 kilometres (623\xa0mi) without recharging.|\n|Zonda Bus|, in |Jiangsu|, |China| offers the |Zonda Bus New Energy| with a 500-kilometre (310\xa0mi) only-electric range.|[61]|[|clarification needed|]|\n|The supercar |Rimac Concept One| with 82\xa0kWh battery has a range of 500\xa0km.

Only 8 have been made and it costs over $1 million.|\n|The pure electric car |BYD e6| with 60\xa0kWh battery has a range of 300\xa0km.|[62]|\n|Specifics|[|edit|]|\n|Internal components|[|edit|]|\n| |Battery pack on the roof of a |battery electric bus|\n| |Electric truck| e-Force One. Battery pack between the axles.|\n|Battery pack designs for electric vehicles (EVs) are complex and vary widely by manufacturer and specific application. However, they all incorporate a combination of several simple mechanical and electrical component systems which perform the basic required functions of the pack.\n|The actual battery cells can have different chemistry, physical shapes, and sizes as preferred by various pack manufacturers. Battery packs will always incorporate many discrete cells connected in series and parallel to achieve the total voltage and current requirements of the pack. Battery packs for all electric drive EVs can contain several hundred individual cells. Each cell has a nominal voltage of 3-4 |volts|, depending on its chemical composition.\n|To assist in manufacturing and assembly, the large stack of cells is typically grouped into smaller stacks called modules. Several of these modules are placed into a single pack. Within each module the cells are welded together to complete the electrical path for current flow. Modules can also incorporate cooling mechanisms, temperature monitors, and other devices. Modules must remain within a specific temperature range for optimal performance.|[63]| In most cases, modules also allow for monitoring the voltage produced by each battery cell in the stack by using a |battery management system| (BMS).|[64]|\n|The battery cell stack has a main fuse which limits the current of the pack under a short circuit. A "service plug" or "service disconnect" can be removed to split the battery stack into two electrically isolated halves. With the service plug removed, the exposed main terminals of the battery present no high potential electrical danger to service technicians.|[64]|[65]|\n|The battery pack also contains relays, or contactors, which control the distribution of the battery pack\'s electrical power to the output terminals. In most cases there will be a minimum of two main relays which connect the battery cell stack to the main positive and negative output terminals of the pack, which then supply high current to the electrical drive motor. Some pack designs include alternate current paths for pre-charging the drive system through a pre-charge resistor or for powering an auxiliary bus which will also have their own associated control relays. For safety reasons these relays are all normally open.|[64]|[65]|\n|The battery pack also contains a variety of temperature, voltage, and current sensors. Collection of data from the pack sensors and activation of the pack relays are accomplished by the pack\'s battery monitoring unit (BMU) or BMS. The BMS is also responsible for communications with the vehicle outside the battery pack.|[64]|\n|\n|Recharging|[|edit|]|\n|Batteries in BEVs must be periodically recharged. BEVs most commonly charge from the |power grid| (at home or using a street or shop |recharging point|), which is in turn generated from a variety of domestic resources, such as |coal|, |hydroelectricity|, |nuclear|, |natural gas|, and others. Home or grid power, such as |photovoltaic| solar cell panels, |wind|, or |microhydro| may also be used and are promoted because of concerns regarding |global warming|.\n|With suitable power supplies, good battery lifespan is usually achieved at charging rates not exceeding half of the capacity of the battery per hour (|"0.5|C|"|),|[66]| thereby taking two or more hours for a full charge, but faster charging is available even for large capacity batteries.|[67]|\n|Charging time at home is limited by the capacity of the household |electrical outlet|, unless specialized electrical wiring work is done.  In the US, Canada, Japan, and other countries with 120|\xa0|V electricity, a normal household outlet delivers 1.5 |kilowatts|. In other countries with 230|\xa0|V electricity between 7 and 14 kilowatts can be delivered (230|\xa0|V single phase and 400|\xa0|V three-phase, respectively). In Europe, a 400|\xa0|V (three-phase 230|\xa0|V) grid connection is increasingly popular since newer houses don\'t have natural gas connection due to the European Union\'s safety regulations.\n|\n|Recharging time|[|edit|]|\n|Electric cars like |Tesla Model S|, |Renault Zoe|, |BMW i3|, etc., can recharge their batteries to 80 percent at quick charging stations within 30 minutes.|[68]|[69]|[70]|[71]|  For example, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range charging on a 250\xa0kW Tesla Version 3 Supercharger went from 2% state of charge with 6 miles (9.7\xa0km) of range to 80% state of charge with 240 miles (390\xa0km) of range in 27 minutes, which equates to 520 miles (840\xa0km) per hour.|[72]|\n|\n|Connectors|[|edit|]|\n|The charging power can be connected to the car in two ways. The first is a direct electrical connection known as |conductive coupling|. This might be as simple as a |mains| lead into a weatherproof |socket| through special high capacity cables with connectors to protect the user from |high voltages|. The modern standard for plug-in vehicle charging is the |SAE|\xa0|1772 conductive connector| (IEC|\xa0|62196 Type|\xa0|1) in the US. The |ACEA| has chosen the |VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2| (IEC|\xa0|62196 Type|\xa0|2) for deployment in Europe, which, without a latch, means unnecessary extra power requirements for the locking mechanism.|[|citation needed|]|\n|The second approach is known as |inductive charging|. A special \'paddle\' is inserted into a slot on the car. The paddle is one winding of a |transformer|, while the other is built into the car. When the paddle is inserted it completes a magnetic circuit which provides power to the battery pack. In one inductive charging system,|[73]| one winding is attached to the underside of the car, and the other stays on the floor of the garage. The advantage of the inductive approach is that there is no possibility of |electrocution| as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks, special connectors and |ground fault detectors| can make conductive coupling nearly as safe. Inductive charging can also reduce vehicle weight, by moving more charging componentry offboard.|[74]| An inductive charging advocate from Toyota contended in 1998, that overall cost differences were minimal, while a conductive charging advocate from Ford contended that conductive charging was more cost efficient.|[74]|\n|\n|Recharging spots|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |charging station|\n|As of April\xa02020|[update]|, there are 93,439 locations and 178,381 EV charging stations worldwide.|[75]|\n|Though there are a lot of charging stations worldwide, and the number is only growing, an issue with this is that an EV driver may find themselves at a remote charging station with another vehicle plugged in to the only charger or they may find another vehicle parked in the only EV spot. Currently, no laws prohibit unplugging another person\'s vehicle, it is simply ruled by etiquette.|[57]|\n|\n|Travel range before recharging|[|edit|]|\n|The range of a BEV depends on the number and type of batteries used. The weight and type of vehicle as well as terrain, weather, and the |performance of the driver| also have an impact, just as they do on the mileage of |traditional vehicles|. |Electric vehicle conversion| performance depends on a number of factors including the battery chemistry:\n|\n|Lead-acid batteries are the most available and inexpensive. Such conversions generally have a range of 30–80\xa0km (19–50\xa0mi). Production EVs with lead-acid batteries are capable of up to 130\xa0km (81\xa0mi) per charge.|\n|NiMH| batteries have higher specific energy than lead-acid; prototype EVs deliver up to 200\xa0km (120\xa0mi) of range.|\n|New lithium-ion battery-equipped EVs provide 320–480\xa0km (200–300\xa0mi) of range per charge.|[76]| Lithium is also less expensive than nickel.|[77]|\n|Nickel-zinc battery| are cheaper and lighter than |Nickel-cadmium batteries|. They are also cheaper than (but not as light as) lithium-ion batteries.|[78]|\n|The |internal resistance| of some batteries may be significantly increased at low temperature|[79]| which can cause noticeable reduction in the range of the vehicle and on the lifetime of the battery.\n|Finding the economic balance of range versus performance, battery capacity versus weight, and battery type versus cost challenges every EV manufacturer.\n|With an AC system or advanced DC system, |regenerative braking| can extend range by up to 50% under extreme traffic conditions without complete stopping. Otherwise, the range is extended by about 10 to 15% in city driving, and only negligibly in highway driving, depending upon terrain.|[|citation needed|]|\n|BEVs (including buses and trucks) can also use |genset trailers| and |pusher trailers| in order to extend their range when desired without the additional weight during normal short range use. Discharged basket trailers can be replaced by recharged ones en route. If rented then maintenance costs can be deferred to the agency.\n|Some  BEVs can become |Hybrid vehicles| depending on the trailer and car types of energy and powertrain.\n|\n|Trailers|[|edit|]|\n|Auxiliary battery capacity carried in trailers can increase the overall vehicle range, but also increases the loss of power arising from |aerodynamic drag|, increases |weight transfer| effects and reduces |traction| capacity.\n|\n|Swapping and removing|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |battery swapping|\n|An alternative to recharging is to exchange drained or nearly drained batteries (or |battery range extender modules|) with fully charged batteries. This is called battery swapping and is done in |exchange stations|.|[80]|\n|Features of swap stations include:|[81]|\n|\n|The consumer is no longer concerned with battery capital cost, life cycle, technology, maintenance, or warranty issues;|\n|Swapping is far faster than charging: battery swap equipment built by the firm |Better Place| has demonstrated automated swaps in less than 60\xa0seconds;|[82]|\n|Swap stations increase the feasibility of distributed energy storage via the electric grid;|\n|Concerns about swap stations include:\n|\n|Potential for fraud (battery quality can only be measured over a full discharge cycle; battery lifetime can only be measured over repeated discharge cycles; those in the swap transaction cannot know if they are getting a worn or reduced effectiveness battery; battery quality degrades slowly over time, so worn batteries will be gradually forced into the system)|\n|Manufacturers\' unwillingness to standardize battery access / implementation details|[83]|\n|Safety concerns|[83]|\n|Re-filling|[|edit|]|\n|Zinc-bromine flow batteries| can be re-filled using a liquid, instead of recharged by connectors, saving time.\n|\n|Lifecycle of lithium-based EV batteries|[|edit|]|\n| |Schematic of life cycle of EV batteries. Adapted from Engel et al.|[84]|\n|There are mainly four stages during the lifecycle  of  lithium-based  EV  batteries:  the raw materials phase, the battery manufacturing, operation phase and the end-of-life management phase. As shown in the schematic of life cycle of EV batteries, during the first stage, the rare earth materials are extracted in different parts of the world. After they are refined by pre-processing factories, the battery manufacturing companies take over these materials and start to produce batteries and assemble them into packs.  These battery packs are then sent to car manufacturing companies for EV integration.  In the last  stage,  if  no  management  is  in  place, valuable materials in the batteries could be potentially wasted.  A good end-of-life management phase will try to close the loop.  The used battery packs will either be reused as stationary storage or recycled depending on the battery state of health (SOH).|[84]|\n|The battery lifecycle is rather long and requires close cooperation between companies and countries.  Currently, the raw materials phase and the battery manufacturing and operation phase are well established.  The end-of-life management phase is struggled to grow, especially the recycling  process mainly because of economics.  For example, only 6% of lithium-ion batteries were collected for recycling in 2017–2018 in Australia.|[85]| However, closing the loop is extremely important. Not only because of a predicted tightened supply of nickel, cobalt and lithium in the future, also recycling EV batteries has the potential to maximize the environmental benefit. Xu et al. predicted that in the sustainable development scenario, lithium, cobalt and nickel will reach or surpass the amount of known reserves in the future if no recycling is in place.|[86]| Ciez and Whitacre found that by deploying battery recycling some green house gas (GHG) emission from mining could be avoided.|[87]|\n|\n| |Battery recycling emissions under US average electricity grid. (a,b) for cylindrical cell and (c,d) for pouch cell. Adapted from Ciez and Whitacre.|[87]|\n| |Manufacturing process of EV batteries|\n|To develop a deeper understanding of the lifecycle of EV batteries, it is important to analyze the emission associated with different phases. Using NMC cylindrical cells as an example, Ciez and Whitacre found that around 9\xa0kg CO|2|e kg battery|−|1| is emitted during raw materials pre-processing and battery manufacturing under the US average electricity grid. The biggest part of the emission came from materials preparation accounting for more than 50% of the emissions. If NMC pouch cell is used, the total emission increases to almost 10\xa0kg CO|2|e kg battery|−|1| while materials manufacturing still contributes to more than 50% of the emission.|[87]| During the end-of-life management phase, the refurbishing process adds little emission to the lifecycle emission. The recycling process, on the other hand, as suggested by Ciez and Whitacre emits a significant amount of GHG. As shown in the battery recycling emission plot a and c, the emission of the recycling process varies with the different recycling processes, different chemistry and different form factor. Thus, the net emission avoided compared to not recycling also varies with these factors. At a glance, as shown in the plot b and d, the direct recycling process is the most ideal process for recycling pouch cell batteries, while the hydrometallurgical process is most suitable for cylindrical type battery. However, with the error bars shown, the best approach cannot be picked with confidence. It is worth noting that for the lithium iron phosphates (LFP) chemistry, the net benefit is negative. Because LFP cells lacks cobalt and nickel which are expensive and energy intensive to produce, it is more energetically efficient to mine. In general, in addition to promoting the growth of a single sector, a more integrated effort should be in place to reduce the lifecycle emission of EV batteries. A finite total supply of rare earth material can apparently justify the need for recycling. But the environmental benefit of recycling needs closer scrutiny. Based on current recycling technology, the net benefit of recycling depends on the form factors, the chemistry and the recycling process chosen.\n|\n|Manufacturing|[|edit|]|\n|There are mainly three stages during the manufacturing process of EV batteries: materials manufacturing, cell manufacturing and integration, as shown in Manufacturing process of EV batteries graph in grey, green and orange color respectively. This shown process does not include manufacturing of cell hardware, i.e. casings and current collectors. During the materials manufacturing process, the active material, conductivity additives, polymer binder and solvent are mixed first. After this, they are coated on the current collectors ready for the drying process. During this stage, the methods of making active materials depend on the electrode and the chemistry. For the cathode, two of the most popular chemistry are transition metal oxides, i.e. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (Li-NMC) and Lithium metal phosphates, i.e. Lithium iron phosphates (LFP). For the anode, the most popular chemistry now is graphite. However, recently there have been a lot of companies started to make Si mixed anode (|Sila Nanotech|, |Prologium|) and Li metal anode(|Cuberg|, |Solid Power|). In general, for active materials production, there are three steps: materials preparation, materials processing and refinement. Schmuch et al. discussed materials manufacturing in greater details.|[88]|\n|In the cell manufacturing stage, the prepared electrode will be processed to the desired shape for packaging in a cylindrical, rectangular or pouch format. Then after filling the electrolytes and sealing the cells, the battery cells are cycled carefully to form SEI protecting the anode. Then, these batteries are assembled into packs ready for vehicle integration. Kwade et al. discuss the overall battery manufacturing process in greater detail.\n|\n|Reusing and repurposing|[|edit|]|\n|When an EV battery pack degrades to 70% to 80% of its original capacity, it is defined to reach the end-of-life. One of the waste management methods is to reuse the pack. By repurposing the pack for stationary storage, more value can be extracted from the battery pack while reducing the per kWh lifecycle impact. However, enabling battery second-life is not easy. Several challenges are hindering the development of the battery refurbishing industry.\n|First, uneven and undesired battery degradation happens during EV operation. Each battery cell could degrade differently during operation. Currently, the state of health (SOH) information from a battery management system (BMS) can be extracted on a pack level. Getting the cell state of health information requires next-generation BMS. In addition, because a lot of factors could contribute to the low SOH at the end of life, such as temperature during operation, charging/discharging pattern and calendar degradation, the degradation mechanism could be different. Thus, just knowing the SOH is not enough to ensure the quality of the refurbished pack. To solve this challenge, engineers can mitigate the degradation by engineering the next-generation thermal management system. To fully understand the degradation inside the battery, computational methods including the first-principle method, physics-based model and machine learning based method should work together to identify the different degradation modes and quantify the level of degradation after severe operations. Lastly, more efficient battery characteristics tools, for instance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) should be used to ensure the quality of the battery pack.|[89]|[90]|\n|\n| |Examples of storage projects using second-life EV batteries. Adapted from Awan|[89]|\n|Second, it is costly and time-intensive to disassemble modules and cells. Following the last point, the first step is testing to determine the remaining SOH of the battery modules. This operation could vary for each retired system. Next, the module must be fully discharged. Then, the pack must be disassembled and reconfigured to meet the power and energy requirement of the second life application. It is important to note that qualified workers and specialized tools are required to dismantle the high weight and high voltage EV batteries. Besides the solutions discussed in the previous section, a refurbishing company can sell or reuse the discharged energy from the module to reduce the cost of this process. To accelerate the disassembly process, there have been several attempts to incorporate robots in this process. In this case, robots can handle more dangerous task increasing the safety of the dismantling process.|[89]|[91]|\n|Third, battery technology is non-transparent and lacks standards. Because battery development is the core part of EV, it is difficult for the manufacturer to label the exact chemistry of cathode, anode and electrolytes on the pack. In addition, the capacity and the design of the cells and packs changes on a yearly basis. The refurbishing company needs to closely work with the manufacture to have a timely update on this information. On the other hand, government can set up labeling standard.|[89]|\n|Lastly, the refurbishing process adds cost to the used batteries. Since 2010, the battery costs have decreased by over 85% which is significantly faster than the prediction. Because of the added cost of refurbishing, the refurbished unit may be less attractive than the new batteries to the market.|[89]|\n|Nonetheless, there have been several successes on the second-life application as shown in the examples of storage projects using second-life EV batteries. They are used in less demanding stationary storage application as peak shaving or additional storage for renewable-based generating sources.|[89]|\n|\n|Recycling|[|edit|]|\n| |Examples of current lithium-ion battery recycling facilities. Adapted from Awan|[89]|\n|Although battery life span can be extended by enabling a second-life application, ultimately EV batteries need to be recycled. Recyclability is not currently an important design consideration for battery manufacturers, and in 2019 only 5% of electric vehicle batteries were recycled.|[92]| BEV technologies lack an established recycling framework in many countries, making the usage of BEV and other battery-operated electrical equipment a large energy expenditure, ultimately increasing CO|2| emissions - especially in countries lacking renewable energy resources.|[93]| Currently, there are five types of recycling processes: Pyrometallurgical recovery, Physical materials separation, Hydrometallurgical metal reclamation, Direct recycling method and Biological metals reclamation. The most widely used processes are the first three processes listed, as shown in the examples of current lithium-ion battery recycling facilities. The last two methods are still on lab or pilot scale, however, they can potentially avoid the largest amount of emission from mining.\n|The pyrometallurgical process involves burning the battery materials with slag, limestone, sand and coke to produce a metal alloy using a high-temperature furnace. The resulted materials are a metallic alloy, slag and gases. The gases comprise molecules that are evaporated from the electrolyte and binder components. The metal alloy can be separated through hydrometallurgical processes into constituent materials. The slag which is a mixture of metals aluminum, manganese and lithium can either be reclaimed by hydrometallurgical processes or used in the cement industry. This process is very versatile and relatively safe. Because there is no pre-sorting needed, it can work with a wide variety of batteries. In addition, because the whole cell is burnt, the metal from the current collectors could help the smelting process and because of the exothermic reaction of burning electrolyte sand plastics the energy consumption can also be reduced. However, this process still requires relatively higher energy consumption and only a limited number of materials can be reclaimed. Physical materials separation recovered materials by mechanical crushing and exploiting physical properties of different components such as particle size, density, ferromagnetism and hydrophobicity. Copper, aluminum and steel casing can be recovered by sorting. The remaining materials, called "black mass", which is composed of nickel, cobalt, lithium and manganese, need a secondary treatment to recover. For the hydrometallurgical process, the cathode materials need to be crushed to remove the current collector. Then, the cathode materials are leached by aqueous solutions to extract the desired metals from cathode materials. Direct cathode recycling as the name suggested extracts the materials directly, yielding a cathode power that is ready to be used as new cathode pristine material. This process involves extracting the electrolyte using liquid or supercritical CO|2|.\xa0 After the size of the recovered components is reduced, the cathode materials can be separated out. For the biological metals reclamation or bio-leaching, the process uses microorganisms to digest metal oxides selectively. Then, recyclers can reduce these oxides to produce metal nanoparticles. Although bio-leaching has been used successfully in the mining industry, this process is still nascent to the recycling industry and plenty of opportunities exists for further investigation.|[87]|[89]|[91]|\n|There have been many efforts around the world to promote recycling technologies development and deployment. In the US, the Department of Energy Vehicle Technologies Offices (VTO) set up two efforts targeting at innovation and practicability of recycling processes. ReCell Lithium Recycling RD center brings in three universities and three national labs together to develop innovative, efficient recycling technologies. Most notably, the direct cathode recycling method was developed by the ReCell center. On the other hand, VTO also set up the battery recycling prize to incentivize American entrepreneurs to find innovative solutions to solve current challenges.|[94]|\n|\n|Environmental impact|[|edit|]|\n|Transition to electric vehicles is estimated to require an 87,000% increase in supply of specific metals by 2060 that need to be mined initially, with recycling (see above) covering part of the demand in future.|[95]| In the UK alone, it is estimated that switching 31.5 million petrol vehicles to electric would require "207,900 tonnes of cobalt, 264,600 tonnes of lithium carbonate, 7,200 tonnes of neodymium and dysprosium, and 2,362,500 tonnes of copper", and a worldwide switch would require 40 times these amounts.|[96]| In 2022 the US government planned to give US states $5 billion over five years for electric vehicle chargers.|[97]| According to IEA 2021 study, mineral supplies need to increase from 400 kilotonnes in 2020 to 11,800 kilotonnes in 2040 in order to cover the demand by EV. This increase creates a number of key challenges, from supply chain (as 60% of production is concentrated in China) to significant impact on climate and environment as result of such a large increase in mining operations.|[98]|\n|\n|Vehicle-to-grid|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Vehicle-to-grid|\n|Smart grid| allows BEVs to provide power to the grid at any time, especially:\n|\n|During |peak load| periods (When the selling price of electricity can be very high. Vehicles can then be recharged during |off-peak| hours at cheaper rates which helps absorb excess night time generation. The vehicles serve as a distributed battery storage system to buffer power.)|\n|During |blackouts|, as backup power sources.|\n|Safety|[|edit|]|\n|The safety issues of battery electric vehicles are largely dealt with by the international standard |ISO| |6469|. This standard is divided into three parts:\n|\n|On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery|\n|Functional safety means and protection against failures|\n|Protection of persons against electrical hazards.|\n|Firefighters| and rescue personnel receive special training to deal with the higher voltages and chemicals encountered in electric and hybrid electric vehicle accidents. While BEV accidents may present unusual problems, such as fires and fumes resulting from rapid battery discharge, many experts agree that BEV batteries are safe in commercially available vehicles and in rear-end collisions, and are safer than gasoline-propelled cars with rear gasoline tanks.|[99]|\n|Usually, |battery performance testing| includes the determination of:\n|\n|State Of Charge| (SOC)|\n|State of Health (SOH)|\n|Energy Efficiency|\n|Performance testing simulates the drive cycles for the drive trains of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) as per the required specifications of car manufacturers (|OEMs|).

Purchase-based incentives include a tax rebate or a subsidy when buying or registering a modern BEV. Use based policy measures include providing an exemption for congestion charging for BEV users, allowing BEV users to use bus lanes, or giving free parking to BEVs. These can be classified into local and global policy incentives. Local incentives including congestion charge exemptions or free BEV parking in a city only influence those located in this specific area. Global policy incentives including subsidies or national tax rebates apply to anyone in a country.|[116]|\n|In 2009, President |Barack Obama| announced 48 new advanced battery and electric drive projects that would receive US$2.4\xa0billion in funding under the |American Recovery and Reinvestment Act|. The government claimed that these projects would accelerate the development of U.S. manufacturing capacity for batteries and electric drive components as well as the deployment of electric drive vehicles, helping to establish American leadership in creating the next generation of advanced vehicles.|[117]|\n|The announcement marked the single largest investment in advanced battery technology for hybrid and electric-drive vehicles ever made. Industry officials expected that this US$2.4\xa0billion investment, coupled with another US$2.4\xa0billion in cost share from the award winners, would result directly in the creation tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. battery and auto industries.\n|The awards cover US$1.5\xa0billion in |grants| to United States-based manufacturers to produce batteries and their components and to expand battery recycling capacity.\n|\n|U.S. Vice President |Joe Biden| announced in Detroit over US$1\xa0billion in grants to companies and universities based in Michigan. Reflecting the state\'s leadership in clean energy manufacturing, Michigan companies and institutions received the largest share of grant funding of any state. Two companies, |A123 Systems| and |Johnson Controls|, would receive a total of approximately US$550\xa0million to establish a manufacturing base in the state for advanced batteries, and two others, |Compact Power| and |Dow Kokam|,|[118]| would receive a total of over US$300\xa0million for manufacturing battery cells and materials. Large automakers based in Michigan, including GM, Chrysler, and Ford, would receive a total of more than US$400\xa0million to manufacture batteries and electric drive components. Three educational institutions in Michigan — the |University of Michigan|, |Wayne State University| in Detroit, and |Michigan Technological University| in Houghton, in the Upper Peninsula — would receive a total of more than US$10\xa0million for education and workforce training programs to train researchers, technicians, and service providers, and to conduct consumer research to accelerate the transition towards advanced vehicles and batteries.|\n|U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu visited |Celgard|,|[119]| in |Charlotte, North Carolina|, to announce a US$49\xa0million grant for the company to expand its separator production capacity to serve the expected increased demand for lithium-ion batteries from manufacturing facilities in the United States. Celgard was planning to expand its manufacturing capacity in Charlotte, North Carolina, and nearby |Concord, North Carolina|,|[120]| and the company expected the new separator production to come online in 2010. Celgard expected that approximately hundreds of jobs could be created, with the first of those jobs beginning as early as fall 2009.|\n|EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was in St. Petersburg, Florida, to announce a US$95.5\xa0million grant for |Saft America|, Inc.|[121]|[122]| to construct a new plant in |Jacksonville| on the site of the former |Cecil Field| military base, to manufacture lithium-ion cells, modules and battery packs for military, industrial, and agricultural vehicles.|\n|Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation| |John Porcari| visited |East Penn Manufacturing| Co,|[123]| in |Lyon Station, Pennsylvania|, to award the company a US$32.5\xa0million grant to increase production capacity for their |valve regulated lead-acid batteries| and the |UltraBattery|, a |lead-acid battery| combined with a carbon |supercapacitor|, for micro and mild hybrid applications.|[124]|\n|On 2 May 2022, President Biden announced the administration will begin a $3.16 billion plan to boost domestic manufacturing and recycling of batteries, in a larger effort to shift the country away from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles. The goal of the Biden administration is to have half of U.S. automobile production electric by 2030.|[125]|\n|The |Inflation Reduction Act|, passed August 16, 2022, aimed to incentivize clean energy manufacturing with a $7,500 consumer tax credit for EVs with US-built batteries, and subsidies for EV plants. By October 2022, billions of dollars of investment had been announced for over two dozen US battery plants, leading some commentators to nickname the Midwest as the "Battery Belt."|[126]|[127]|\n|\n|Promotion in Norway|[|edit|]|\n|Norway has become a leading example of BEV promotion. The BEV market share is highest in the world in Norway, the main reason being the strong incentives for promoting purchase and ownership of BEVs. Norway has an incentive package for BEVs that often equate or even make a BEV cheaper to purchase than an Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle (ICEV). In addition to the purchase price incentives, there are also incentives that make BEVs more cost-efficient and convenient in daily use. Incentive policies have a clear success for increasing BEV sales in Norway, making it a great case to learn from for other countries wanting to head in the same direction.|[128]|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Examples|[|edit|]|\n|List of hybrid vehicles|\n|List of production battery electric vehicles|\n|List of electric vehicle battery manufacturers|\n|Related|[|edit|]|\n|\n|Battery charging|\n|Battery electric multiple unit|\n|Battery locomotive|\n|Charging station|\n|Dual-mode vehicle|\n|Electric car energy efficiency|\n|Flywheel energy storage|\n|List of battery types|\n|Rechargeable battery|\n|Salt water battery|\n|Traction motor|\n|Vehicle-to-grid| (V2G)|\n|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |"Axeon Receives Order for 50 Zebra Packs for Modec Electric Vehicle; Li-Ion Under Testing"|. |Green Car Congress|. 24 November 2016|.

A |life-cycle assessment| involves production and post-use considerations.

Other approaches include |personal rapid transit|, a |public transportation| concept that offers automated, on-demand, non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways.\n|\n|Electric and fuel cell-powered|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Electric vehicle| and |Plug-in hybrid|\n|Examples of vehicles with reduced petroleum consumption include |electric cars|, |plug-in hybrids| and |fuel cell|-powered |hydrogen cars|.\n|Electric cars| are typically more efficient than |fuel cell|-powered vehicles on a |Tank-to-wheel| basis.|[16]| They have better |fuel economy| than conventional |internal combustion engine| vehicles but are hampered by |range| or maximum distance attainable before discharging the battery. The |electric car batteries| are their main cost. They provide a 0%|[17]| to 99.9% reduction in |CO|2| emissions compared to an |ICE| (gasoline, diesel) vehicle, depending on the source of electricity.|[18]|\n|\n|Hybrid electric vehicles|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Hybrid vehicle|\n|Hybrid cars| may be partly fossil fuel (or biofuel) powered and partly electric or hydrogen-powered. Most combine an internal combustion engine with an electric engine, though other variations too exist. The internal combustion engine is often either a gasoline or Diesel engine (in rare cases a Stirling engine may even be used|[19]|). They are more expensive to purchase but cost redemption is achieved in a period of about 5 years due to better fuel economy.|[14]|[15]|\n|\n|Compressed air cars, stirling vehicles, and others|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Compressed-air vehicle| and |Compressed air car|\n|Compressed air cars|, |stirrling-powered| vehicles, and |Liquid nitrogen vehicles| are less polluting than an electrical vehicles, since the vehicle and its components are environment friendly. However, compressed air vehicles are far beneficial to the environment than vehicles that are considered "eco-friendly". Take the |Toyota Prius|, although it is marketed as an eco-friendly vehicle, it has an environmentally harmful production process. In the words of |Jeremy Clarkson|, a renown British car show host and expert, "The recent study found that in the long term it does more environmental damage than a |Land Rover Discovery|". Alternatively, compressed air vehicles are less environmentally harmful due to their air engine, which allows the car to run on compressed air instead of fuel. The engine is pumped by air instead of gasoline explosions, thus having zero emission motors, no pollution or oil.\n|Solar car races| are held on a regular basis in order to promote green vehicles and other "|green technology|". These sleek driver-only vehicles can travel long distances at highway speeds using only the electricity generated instantaneously from the sun.\n|\n|Improving conventional cars|[|edit|]|\n| |The |Fiat Siena Tetrafuel| 1.4 is a |multifuel| car designed to run as a |flex-fuel| on |gasoline|, or |E20–E25 blend|, or neat ethanol (|E100|); or to run as a |bi-fuel| with |natural gas (CNG)|.|\n|Main articles: |Biofuel|, |compressed natural gas|, and |clean diesel|\n|See also: |Volkswagen emissions scandal|\n|A conventional vehicle can become a greener vehicle by mixing in |renewable fuels| or using less carbon intensive |fossil fuel|. Typical |gasoline|-powered cars can tolerate up to 10% |ethanol|. Brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol, though there were discontinued. Another available option is a |flexible-fuel vehicle| which allows any blend of gasoline and ethanol, up to 85% in North America and Europe, and up to 100% in Brazil.|[20]| Another existing option is to convert a conventional gasoline-powered to allow the alternative use of |CNG|. |Pakistan|, |Argentina|, |Brazil|, |Iran|, |India|, |Italy|, and |China| have the largest fleets of |natural gas vehicles| in the world.|[21]|\n|Diesel|-powered vehicles can often transition completely to |biodiesel|, though the fuel is a very strong |solvent|, which can occasionally damage |rubber| seals in vehicles built before 1994. More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging |filters|, unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel. It is very effective at \'de-coking\' the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean. Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines. Biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some North American national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days. Biodiesel and |vegetable oil fuelled|, diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the US |Tour de Sol| competition.\n|This presents problems, as biofuels can use food resources in order to provide mechanical energy for vehicles. Many experts point to this as a reason for growing food prices, particularly US Bio-ethanol fuel production which has affected maize prices. In order to have a low environmental impact, biofuels should be made only from waste products, or from new sources like |algae|.\n|\n|Electric Motor and Pedal Powered Vehicles|[|edit|]|\n|Multiple companies are offering and developing two, three, and four wheel vehicles combining the characteristics of a bicycle with electric motors. US Federal, State and Local laws do not clearly nor consistently classify|[22]| these vehicles as |bicycles|, |electric bicycles|, |motorcycles|, |electric motorcycles|, |mopeds|, |Neighborhood Electric Vehicle|, |motorised quadricycle| or as a |car|. Some laws have limits on top speeds, power of the motors, range, etc. while others do not.|[23]|[24]|[25]|[26]|\n|\n|Other|[|edit|]|\n|Further information: |Personal rapid transit|\n| |Solar vehicle|\n|Public transportation| vehicles are not usually included in the green vehicle category, but |Personal rapid transit| (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track have the advantage of potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential |PRT energy efficiency| is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.|\n|Solar vehicles| are |electric vehicles| powered by |solar energy| obtained from |solar panels| on the surface (generally, the roof) of the vehicle. |Photovoltaic| (PV) cells convert the Sun\'s energy directly into |electrical energy|. Solar vehicles are not practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. However, some cities have begun offering |solar-powered buses|, including the |Tindo| in |Adelaide, Australia|.|\n|Wind-powered electric vehicles| primarily use wind-turbines installed at a strategic point of the vehicle, which are then converted into electric energy which causes the vehicle to propel.|\n|Animal powered vehicles|[|edit|]|\n|Horse and carriage| are just one type of animal propelled vehicle. Once a common form of transportation, they became far less common as cities grew and automobiles took their place. In dense cities, the waste produced by large numbers of transportation animals was a significant health problem. Oftentimes the food is produced for them using diesel powered tractors, and thus there is some environmental impact as a result of their use.\n|\n|Human powered vehicles|[|edit|]|\n| |Vélo\'v| |bicycle sharing system| in |Lyon|, |France|\n|See also: |Bicycle sharing system|\n|Human-powered transport| includes walking, |bicycles|, |velomobiles|, |row boats|, and other environmentally friendly ways of getting around. In addition to the health benefits of the exercise provided, they are far more environmentally friendly than most other options. The only downside is the speed limitations, and how far one can travel before getting exhausted.\n|\n|Benefits of green vehicle use|[|edit|]|\n|Environmental|[|edit|]|\n|Vehicle emissions contribute to the increasing concentration of gases linked to |climate change|.|[27]|  In order of significance, the principal |greenhouse gases| associated with road transport are carbon dioxide (CO|2|), methane (CH|4|) and nitrous oxide (N|2|O).|[28]| Road transport is the third largest source of greenhouse gases emitted in the UK, and accounts for about 27% of total emissions,|[29]| and 33% in the United States.|[30]|  Of the total |greenhouse gas emissions| from transport, over 85% are due to CO|2| emissions from road vehicles. The transport sector is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases.|[31]|\n|\n|Health|[|edit|]|\n|Vehicle pollutants have been linked to human ill health including the incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer. A 1998 report estimated that up to 24,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK as a direct result of air pollution.|[32]|  According to the |World Health Organization|, up to 13,000 deaths per year among children (aged 0–4 years) across Europe are directly attributable to outdoor pollution. The organization estimates that if pollution levels were returned to within EU limits, more than 5,000 of these lives could be saved each year.\n|\n|Monetary|[|edit|]|\n|Hybrid taxi| |fleet operators| in |New York| have also reported that reduced fuel consumption saves them thousands of dollars per year.|[33]|\n|\n|Criticism|[|edit|]|\n|A study by CNW Marketing Research suggested that the extra energy cost of manufacture, shipping, disposal, and the short lives of some of these types of vehicle (particularly gas-electric |hybrid vehicles|) outweighs any energy savings made by their using less petroleum during their useful lifespan.|[34]|  This type of argument is the long smokestack argument.|[35]|  Critics of the report note that the study prorated all of Toyota\'s hybrid research-and-development costs across the relatively small number of Priuses on the road, rather than using the incremental cost of building a vehicle; used109,000 miles (175,000\xa0km) for the length of life of a Prius (Toyota offers a 150,000-mile (240,000\xa0km) warranty on the Prius\' hybrid components, including the battery), and calculated that a majority of a car\'s cradle-to-grave energy gets expended during the vehicle\'s production, not while it is driven.|[36]|\n|Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman| official Bente Øverli stated that "Cars cannot do anything good for the environment except less damage than others." Based on this opinion, Norwegian law severely restricts the use of "|greenwashing|" to market automobiles, strongly prohibiting advertising a vehicle as being environmentally friendly, with large fines issued to violators.|[37]|[38]|[39]|[40]|\n|Some studies try to compare environmental impact of electric and petrol vehicles over complete life cycle, including production, operation, and dismantling. \n|[41]|\n|[42]|\n|[43]|\n|[44]|\nIn general, results differ vastly dependent on the region considered, due to difference in energy sources to produce electricity that fuels electric vehicles. When considering only CO|2| emissions, it is noted that production of electric cars generate about twice as much emissions as that of internal combustion cars.|[41]| However, emissions of CO|2| during operation are much larger (on average) than during production. For electric cars, emissions caused during operation depend on energy sources used to produce electricity and thus vary a lot geographically. Studies suggest that when taking into account both production and operation, electric cars would cause more emissions in economies where production of electricity is not clean, e.g., it is mostly coal based.|[42]|[43]| For this reason, some studies found that driving electric cars is less environmentally damaging in western US states than in eastern ones, where less electricity is produced using cleaner sources. Similarly, in countries like India, Australia or China, where large portion of electricity is produced by using coal, driving electric vehicles would cause larger environmental damage than driving petrol vehicles. When justifying use of electric cars over petrol cars, these kinds of studies do not provide sufficiently clear results. Environmental impact is calculated based on fuel mix used to produce electricity that powers electric cars. However, when a gas vehicle is replaced by an equivalent electric vehicle, additional power must be installed in electrical grid. This additional capacity would normally not be based on the same ratios of energy sources ("clean" versus fossil fuels) than the current capacity. Only when additional electricity production capacity installed to switch from petrol to electric vehicles would predominantly consist of clean sources, switch to electric vehicles could reduce environmental damage. Another common problem in methodology used in comparative studies is that it only focuses on specific kinds of environmental impact. While some studies focus only on emission of gas pollutants over life cycle or only on greenhouse gas emissions such as CO|2|, comparison should also account for other environmental impacts such as pollutants released otherwise during production and operation or ingredients that can not be effectively recycled.|[45]| Examples include use of lighter high performing metals, lithium batteries and more rare metals in electric cars, which all have high environmental impact.\n|A study that also looked at factors other than energy consumption and carbon emissions has suggested that there is no such thing as an environmentally friendly car.|[46]|\n|The use of vehicles with increased |fuel efficiency| is usually considered positive in the short term but criticism of any hydrocarbon-based personal transport remains.  The |Jevons paradox| suggests that energy efficiency programs are often counter-productive, even increasing energy consumption in the long run.|[47]| Many environmental researchers believe that |sustainable transport| may require a move away from hydrocarbon fuels and from our present automobile and highway paradigm.|[48]|[49]|[50]|\n|\n|National and international promotion|[|edit|]|\n|European Union|[|edit|]|\n|The |European Union| is promoting the marketing of greener cars via a combination of binding and non-binding measures.|[51]| As of April 2010, 15 of the 27 |member states of the European Union| provide tax incentives for |electrically chargeable vehicles| and some |alternative fuel vehicles|, which includes all |Western European| countries except |Italy| and |Luxembourg|, plus the |Czech Republic| and |Romania|. The incentives consist of tax reductions and exemptions, as well as of bonus payments for buyers of |electric cars|, |plug-in hybrids|, |hybrid electric vehicles| and |natural gas vehicles|.|[52]|[53]|\n|\n|United States|[|edit|]|\n|The |United States Environmental Protection Agency| (EPA) is promoting the marketing of greener cars via the |SmartWay| program. The SmartWay and SmartWay Elite designation mean that a vehicle is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles. This US EPA designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle\'s Air Pollution Score and Greenhouse Gas Score. Higher Air Pollution Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog relative to other vehicles. Higher Greenhouse Gas Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide and have improved fuel economy relative to other vehicles.\n|To earn the SmartWay designation, a vehicle must earn at least a 6 on the Air Pollution Score and at least a 6 on the Greenhouse Gas Score, but have a combined score of at least 13. SmartWay Elite is given to those vehicles that score 9 or better on both the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Scores.\n|A Green Vehicle Marketing Alliance, in conjunction with the |Oak Ridge National Laboratory| (ORNL), periodically meets, and coordinates marketing efforts.|[54]|\n|\n|Green car rankings|[|edit|]|\n|This section needs to be |updated|.| Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.| |(|February 2022|)| |Hyundai Ioniq Electric|\n| |BMW i3| electric car|\n| |Toyota Prius Eco| (4th gen)|\n| |Chevrolet Bolt EV|\n| |Chevrolet Volt (2nd gen.)| plug-in hybrid|\n| |Chevrolet Volt| (1st gen) |plug-in hybrid|\n| |Nissan Leaf| |electric car|\n| |Toyota Mirai| |hydrogen| |fuel cell car|\n| |Mitsubishi i-MiEV| electric car|\n| |Ford Focus Electric|\n| |Ford C-Max Energi| plug-in hybrid|\n| |Tesla Model S| electric car|\n| |BMW i8| |plug-in hybrid|\n| |Ford Fusion Energi| plug-in hybrid|\n| |Honda Accord plug-in hybrid|\n| |Honda FCX Clarity| |hydrogen| |fuel cell car|\n| |Toyota Prius (3rd gen)|\n| |Honda Civic Hybrid (2nd gen)|\n| |Ford Fusion Hybrid (1st gen)|\n| |Honda Insight (2nd gen)|\n| |Honda Civic GX|\n|Several automobile magazines, motor vehicle specialized publications and |environmental groups| publish annual rankings or listings of the best green |cars of a given year|.

Passenger cars with a one-box design include the 1984 |Renault Espace|, 1992 |Renault Twingo I|, 2008 |Tata Nano|, 2005 |Toyota Aygo|/|Citroën C1|/|Peugeot 107| and 1997 |Mercedes-Benz A-Class|.\n|\n|Two-box design|[|edit|]|\n|Two-box| designs articulate a volume for engine and a volume that combines passenger and cargo volumes, e.g., |station wagon/estate| or (three or five-door) |hatchbacks| like the |Saab 900|, and minivans like the |Chrysler minivan|, 2001 |Volkswagen Polo Mk4| and 1999 |Skoda Fabia| Mk1.|[1]|[2]|\n|\n|Three-box design|[|edit|]|\n| |A three-box |coupé|, the |Fiat 124|\n| |A three-box |hatchback|, the |European Ford Escort|\n| |A three-box |sedan/saloon|, the |Renault Dauphine|\n|Three-box design is a broad automotive styling term describing a |coupé|, |sedan/saloon|, |notchback| or |hatchback| where—when viewed in profile—principal volumes are articulated into three separate compartments or boxes: engine, passenger and cargo.|[1]|\n|Three-box designs are highly variable.  |Hemmings Motor News| said:\n|\n|These three boxes, compartmentalized as they are, are used to denote distinct areas of an automobile—specifically a sedan. The engine under the hood and surrounding compartment is the first box. The passenger seating area is another, or second box. The last or third box is the cargo or trunk area. There is no rule as to which box needs to be where.|[3]|\n|Where the |Renault Dauphine| is a three-box that carries its engine in the rear and its cargo up front, the styling of the |Škoda Octavia| integrates a |hatchback| with the articulation of a three-box. This style was later used by its larger |Škoda Superb|, which marketed as the TwinDoor, within the liftgate operable as a trunk lid or as a full hatchback. As with the third generation European |Ford Escort| (also a hatchback), the third box may be vestigial.  And three-box styling does not need to be boxy: |Car Design News| calls the fluid and rounded |Fiat Linea| a three-box design|[4]|—and most examples of the markedly bulbous styling of the |ponton genre| are three-box designs.\n|In 2012, |Hemmings Motor News| wrote "the three-box sedan design is seen as traditional or—worse—conventional."|[3]| \nBy 2016 In the United States, the three-box sedan began to wane in popularity.|[5]|[6]|  In 2018, the Wall Street Journal wrote: "from gangster getaway cars and the Batmobile to the humble family sedan, the basic three-box configuration of a passenger car—low engine compartment, higher cabin, low trunk in the rear—has endured for decades as the standard shape of the automobile.  Until now."|[5]|\n|Sales and popularity of 4-door notchback sedans/saloons began declining in Europe since mid-1990s, especially affordable ones. This is resulted in moving production of Volkswagen Jetta in Mexico, as well as the Peugeot abandoning that segment since 2001 when the production of |Peugeot 306| ended. Other, predominantly European manufacturers followed suit, with the most recent generation of Opel Astra may no longer to be offered as the 4-door notchback. Since 2018, Ford reduced sales of 4-door |Focus| as well as |Mondeo| to Eastern Balkans markets. Again, Volkswagen stopped sales of |Jetta| in Europe around the same time due to too long dimensions, exceeding those with International |Passat B8|.\n|\n|Car roof classification|[|edit|]|\n|A related classification is based on the style of roof in the car design. The DrivAer aerodynamics model of the Technical University of Munich|[7]| classifies roof styles as (F) |Fastback|, (E) |Estate Back|, (N) |Notchback|/|Sedan|.|[8]|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Ponton styling|\n|Coke bottle styling|\n|Glossary of automotive design|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^ |a| |b| |c| |d| |"Starting Out: Car Design Glossary - Part 2 pg 3"|. |www.cardesignnews.com|.

Such systems combine the low unit costs of |mass production| processes with the flexibility of individual customization.|Mass customization is the new frontier in business for both manufacturing and service industries. At its core, is a tremendous increase in variety and customization without a corresponding increase in costs. At its limit, it is the mass production of individually customized goods and services. At its best, it provides strategic advantage and economic value.|[1]| It is one of the product design strategies and is currently used with both techniques (delay differentiation and modular design) together with effective innovative climate to enhance the value delivered to customers.|[2]|\n|Mass customization is the method of "effectively |postponing| the task of differentiating a product for a specific customer until the latest possible point in the supply network".|[3]| Kamis, Koufaris and Stern (2008) conducted experiments to test the impacts of mass customization when postponed to the stage of retail, online shopping. They found that users perceive greater usefulness and enjoyment with a mass customization interface vs. a more typical shopping interface, particularly in a task of moderate complexity.|[4]| From collaborative engineering perspective, mass customization can be viewed as collaborative efforts between customers and manufacturers, who have different sets of priorities and need to jointly search for solutions that best match customers\' individual specific needs with manufacturers\' customization capabilities.|[5]|\n|The concept of mass customization is attributed to Stan Davis in |Future Perfect|,|[6]| and was defined by |Tseng & Jiao (2001|, p.\xa0685) as "producing goods and services to meet individual customers\' needs with near mass production efficiency". |Kaplan & Haenlein (2006)| concurred, calling it "a strategy that creates value by some form of company-customer interaction at the fabrication and assembly stage of the operations level to create customized products with production cost and monetary price similar to those of mass-produced products". Similarly, |McCarthy (2004|, p.\xa0348)| harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFMcCarthy2004 (|help|)| highlights that mass customization involves balancing operational drivers by defining it as "the capability to manufacture a relatively high volume of product options for a relatively large market (or collection of niche markets) that demands customization, without tradeoffs in cost, delivery and quality".\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Implementation|\n|2| |Variants|\n|3| |See also|\n|4| |Notes|\n|5| |References|\n|\n|\n|Implementation|[|edit|]|\n|Many implementations of mass customization are operational today, such as |software|-based product configurators that make it possible to add and/or change functionalities of a core product or to build fully custom enclosures from scratch. This degree of mass customization, however, has only seen limited adoption. If an enterprise\'s marketing department offers individual products (atomic market fragmentation), it doesn\'t often mean that a product is produced individually, but rather that similar variants of the same |mass-produced| item are available. Additionally, in a fashion context, existing technologies to predict clothing size from user input data have been shown to be not yet of high enough suitability for mass customisation purposes.|[7]|\n|Companies that have succeeded with mass-customization business models tend to supply purely electronic products.|[8]| However, these are not true "mass customizers" in the original sense, since they do not offer an alternative to mass production of material goods.\n|\n|Variants|[|edit|]|\n|Pine (1992)| harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFPine1992 (|help|)| described four types of mass customization:|[1]|\n|\n|Collaborative customization (also considered |co-creation|) – Firms talk to individual customers to determine the precise |product offering| that best serves the customer\'s needs (see |personalized marketing| and personal marketing orientation). This information is then used to specify and manufacture a product that suits that specific customer. For example, some clothing companies will manufacture pants or jackets to fit an individual customer. This is also being taken into deeper customization via 3D printing with companies like |Shapeways|.  Examples: |Tailored suits|; |Converse| lets consumers chose the color or pattern of every element of certain types of shoes, either in-store or online.|\n|Adaptive customization – Firms produce a standardized product, but this product is customizable in the hands of the |end-user| (the customers alter the product themselves). Example: |Lutron| lights, which are programmable so that customers can easily customize the aesthetic effect.|[9]|\n|Transparent customization – Firms provide individual customers with unique products, without explicitly telling them that the products are customized. In this case there is a need to accurately assess customer needs. Example: Google |AdWords| and |AdSense|\n|Cosmetic customization – Firms produce a standardized physical product, but market it to different customers in unique ways. Example: Soft Drink served in: A can, 1.25L bottle, 2L bottle.|[|clarification needed|]|\n|He suggested a business model, "the 8.5-figure-path", a process going from |invention| to mass production to |continuous improvement| to mass customization and back to invention.\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Configurator|\n|Dell|\n|Industry 4.0|\n|Knowledge-based configuration|\n|Long tail|\n|Mail merge|\n|Manufacturing|\n|Personalization|\n|Personalized marketing|\n|Product differentiation|\n|Product management|\n|Prosumer|\n|Rapid manufacturing|\n|Responsive computer-aided design|\n|Structure chart|\n|Variable data printing|\n|Notes|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^ |a| |b| |Pine, B.

The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19\xa0mph) with the support of an elevated rail.|[22]|[23]|\n|A landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with |Carnegie Mellon University|\'s |Navlab|[24]| and ALV|[25]|[26]| projects funded by the United States\' |Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency| (DARPA) starting in 1984 and |Mercedes-Benz| and |Bundeswehr University Munich|\'s |EUREKA Prometheus Project| in 1987.|[27]| By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19\xa0mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and night time conditions by 1987.|[28]| A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with Carnegie Mellon University\'s Navlab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849\xa0mi (4,585\xa0km) between |Pittsburgh|, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797\xa0mi (4,501\xa0km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8\xa0mph (102.7\xa0km/h).|[29]|[30]|[31]|[32]| From the 1960s through the second |DARPA Grand Challenge| in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.|[33]| Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.|[27]|[34]|[35]|[36]|[37]|[38]|[39]|[40]|[41]|\n|The US allocated US$650\xa0million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.|[42]| Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848\xa0mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797\xa0mi) or 98% of it autonomously.|[43]| Navlab\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400\xa0mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.|[44]| In 2015, the US states of |Nevada|, Florida, California, |Virginia|, and |Michigan|, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.|[45]|\n|From 2016 to 2018, the |European Commission| funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.|[46]| Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.|[47]|\n|In November 2017, |Waymo| announced that it had begun testing driver-less cars without a safety driver in the driver position;|[48]| however, there was still an employee in the car.|[49]| An October 2017 report by the |Brookings Institution| found that the $80\xa0billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was "reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this".|[50]|\n|In October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000\xa0km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.|[51]| In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.|[52]| In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driver-less ride hailing service in Phoenix.|[53]|[54]| The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.|[55]|[54]|\n|In March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series |Roborace|, Robocar set the |Guinness World Record| for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42\xa0km/h (175.49\xa0mph) – an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.|[56]|\n|In 2020, a |National Transportation Safety Board| chairman stated that no self-driving cars (|SAE level 3+|) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\n|\n|There is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when |advanced driver assistance systems| are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\'re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\'t own a self-driving car.|[57]|\n|On 5 March 2021, |Honda| began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 |Legend Hybrid EX| sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous "Traffic Jam Pilot" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.|[14]|[15]|[58]|[16]|\n|\n|Definitions|[|edit|]|\n|There is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\n|In 2014, such confusion has been documented in |SAE J3016| which states that "some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS [automated driving system] at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS)."\n|\n|Terminology and safety considerations|[|edit|]|\n|Modern vehicles provide features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls, or emergency braking. Those features alone are just considered as |driver assistance technologies| because they still require a human driver control while fully automated vehicles drive themselves without human driver input.\n|According to Fortune, some newer vehicles\' technology names—such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot—might confuse the driver, who may believe no driver input is expected when in fact the driver needs to remain involved in the driving task.|[59]| According to the |BBC|, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.|[60]|\n|For this reason, some organizations such as the |AAA| try to provide standardized naming conventions for features such as ALKS which aim to have capacity to manage the driving task, but which are not yet approved to be an automated vehicles in any countries. The |Association of British Insurers| considers the usage of the word |autonomous| in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think "autonomous" and "autopilot" mean a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology able to drive a car is still in its beta stage.\n|Some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are |self-driving| when they are not able to manage some driving situations. Despite being called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its offering should not be considered as a fully autonomous driving system.|[61]| This makes drivers risk becoming excessively confident, taking |distracted driving| behavior, leading to crashes. While in Great-Britain, a fully self-driving car is only a car registered in a specific list.|[62]| There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics.|[63]|\n|According to the SMMT, "There are two clear states – a vehicle is either assisted with a driver being supported by technology or automated where the technology is effectively and safely replacing the driver."|[64]|\n|\n|Autonomous vs. automated|[|edit|]|\n|Autonomous| means self-governing.|[65]| Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been |automated| (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment, and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.|[65]|\n|One approach is to implement |communication networks| both in the immediate vicinity (for |collision avoidance|) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle\'s autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n|As of 2017|[update]|, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. |Euro NCAP| defines autonomous in "|Autonomous Emergency Braking|" as: "the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident", which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.|[66]|\n|In Europe, the words |automated| and |autonomous| might be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles (...) defines "automated vehicle" and "fully automated vehicle" based on their autonomous capacity:|[67]|\n|\n|"automated vehicle" means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required;|[67]|\n|"fully automated vehicle" means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision;|[67]|\n|In British English, the word automated alone might have several meaning, such in the sentence: "Thatcham also found that the |automated| lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as \'|automated| driving\', instead it claims the tech should be classed as "assisted driving".":|[68]| The first occurrence of the "automated" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second occurrence refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. The British law interprets the meaning of "automated vehicle" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle "driving itself" and an |insured vehicle|.|[69]|\n|\n|Autonomous versus cooperative|[|edit|]|\n|To enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle, some companies use a remote driver.|[70]|\n|\nAccording to |SAE J3016|, |Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.|\n|Classifications|[|edit|]|\n|Self-driving car|[|edit|]|\n|PC Magazine| defines a self-driving car as "a computer-controlled car that drives itself".|[71]| The |Union of Concerned Scientists| states that self-driving cars are "cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or "driver-less" cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle."|[72]|\n|The British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines a vehicle as "driving itself" if the vehicle "is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual".|[73]|\n|Another British definition assumes: "Self-driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves."|[74]|\n|\n|SAE classification|[|edit|]|\n| |Tesla Autopilot| is classified as an SAE Level 2 system.|[75]|[76]|\n|A classification system with six levels – ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems – was published in 2014 by standardization body |SAE International| as J3016, |Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems|; the details are revised periodically.|[13]| This classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle\'s capabilities, although these are loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the |National Highway Traffic Safety Administration| (NHTSA) had released its original formal classification system. After SAE updated its classification in 2016, called J3016_201609,|[77]| NHTSA adopted the SAE standard,|[78]| and SAE classification became widely accepted.|[79]|\n|\n|\n|Levels of driving automation|[|edit|]|\n|In SAE\'s automation level definitions, "driving mode" means "a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)"|[1]|[80]|\n|\n|Level 0|: The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.|\n|Level 1| ("hands on"): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed (|Cruise control|) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed (|Adaptive cruise control| or ACC); and |Parking Assistance|, where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. |Lane Keeping Assistance| (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. |Automatic emergency braking| which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to |Autopilot Review| magazine.|[81]|\n|Level 2| ("hands off"): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and |steering|. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand "hands off" is not meant to be taken literally – contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver may be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping their attention to traffic. Actual hands off driving is sometimes considered level 2.5, although there are no official half-levels. A common example is adaptive cruise control, which also utilizes lane keeping assist technology so that the driver simply monitors the vehicle, such as "Super-Cruise" in the Cadillac CT6 by General Motors or Ford\'s F-150 BlueCruise.|[82]|\n|Level 3| ("eyes off"): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a film. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. This level of automation can be thought of as a co-driver or co-pilot that\'s ready to alert the driver in an orderly fashion when swapping their turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur|[83]| (a car satisfying the international |Automated Lane Keeping Systems| (ALKS) regulations).|[84]|\n|Level 4| ("mind off"): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver\'s seat. However, self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas (|geofenced|) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. slow down and park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that covers selected locations in an area, at a specific time and quantities. |Automated valet parking| is another example.|\n|Level 5| ("steering wheel optional"): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces, all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.|\n|In the formal SAE definition below, an important transition is from SAE Level 2 to SAE Level 3 in which the human driver is no longer expected to monitor the environment continuously. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n|\n|\n|SAE (J3016) Automation Levels|[80]|\n|\n|\n|SAE Level|\n|Name|\n|Narrative definition|\n|Execution of|steering and|acceleration/|deceleration|\n|Monitoring of driving environment|\n|Fallback performance of dynamic driving task|\n|System capability (driving modes)\n|\n|\n|Human driver monitors the driving environment|\n|\n|\n|0|\n|No Automation|\n|The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when "enhanced by warning or intervention systems"|\n|Human driver|\n|Human driver|\n|Human driver|\n|N/a\n|\n|\n|1|\n|Driver Assistance|\n|The driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of |either steering or acceleration/deceleration|\n|Using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task|\n|Human driver and system|\n|Some driving modes\n|\n|\n|2|\n|Partial Automation|\n|The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of |both steering and acceleration/deceleration|\n|System\n|\n|\n|Automated driving system monitors the driving environment|\n|\n|\n|3|\n|Conditional Automation|\n|The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task|\n|With the expectation that the |human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene|\n|System|\n|System|\n|Human driver|\n|Some driving modes\n|\n|\n|4|\n|High Automation|\n|Even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene| the car can pull over safely by guiding system|\n|System|\n|Many driving modes\n|\n|\n|5|\n|Full Automation|\n|Under all roadway and environmental conditions| that can be managed by a human driver|\n|All driving modes\n|\n|Criticism of SAE|[|edit|]|\n|The SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not always be the case.|[85]| The SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure|[86]| and road user behavior.|[87]|[88]|\n|\n|Technology|[|edit|]|\n|This section |is written like a |personal reflection, personal essay, or argumentative essay| that states a Wikipedia editor\'s personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic.| Please |help improve it| by rewriting it in an |encyclopedic style|.| |(|April 2022|)| (|Learn how and when to remove this template message|)|\n|General perspectives|[|edit|]|\n|Several classifications have been proposed to deal with the broad range of technological discussions pertaining to self-driving cars. One such proposal is to classify based on the following categories; car navigation, path planning, environment perception and car control.|[89]| In the 2020s, it became apparent that these technologies are far more complex than initially thought.|[90]|[91]| Even video games have been used as a platform to test autonomous vehicles.|[92]|\n|\n|Hybrid navigation|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Hybrid navigation|\n|Hybrid navigation is the simultaneous use of more than one |navigation system| for location data determination, needed for |navigation|.\n|Sensing|\nTo reliably and safely operate an autonomous vehicle, usually a mixture of sensors is utilized.|[91]|\nTypical sensors include |lidar| (Light Detection and Ranging), |stereo vision|, |GPS| and |IMU|.|[93]|[94]|\nModern self-driving cars generally use |Bayesian| |simultaneous localization and mapping| (SLAM) algorithms,\nwhich fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates.|[95]| \nWaymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians. Simpler systems may use roadside |real-time locating system| (RTLS) technologies to aid localization.\n|Maps|\nSelf-driving cars require a new class of |high-definition maps| (HD maps) that represent the world at up to two orders of magnitude more detail.|[91]| In May 2018, researchers from the |Massachusetts Institute of Technology| (MIT) announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads.|[96]| Researchers at their |Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory| (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a "sparse topological map" such as |OpenStreetMap| (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions.|[97]|\n|Sensor fusion|\nControl systems on automated cars may use |sensor fusion|, which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful view of the environment.|[98]| Self-driving cars tend to use a combination of cameras, LiDAR sensors, and radar sensors in order to enhance performance and ensure the safety of the passenger and other drivers on the road. An increased consistency in self-driving performance prevents accidents that may occur because of one faulty sensor.|[99]|\n|Path planning|\n|Path planning| is a |computational problem| to find a sequence of valid configurations that moves the object from the source to destination. Self-driving cars rely on path planning technology in order to follow the rules of traffic and prevent accidents from occurring. The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a |voronoi diagram|, an |occupancy grid mapping|, or with a driving corridors algorithm.|[100]| A driving corridors algorithm allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open free space that is bounded by lanes or barriers. While these algorithms work in a simple situation, path planning has not been proven to be effective in a complex scenario. Two techniques used for path planning are graph-based search and variational-based optimization techniques. Graph-based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicle/obstacle. Variational-based optimization techniques require a higher level of planning in setting restrictions on the vehicle\'s driving corridor to prevent collisions.|[101]|\n|\n|Drive by wire|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Drive by wire|\n|Drive by wire technology in the automotive industry is the use of electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages.\n|\n|Driver monitoring system|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Driver monitoring system|\n|Driver monitoring system is a vehicle safety system to assess the driver\'s alertness and warn the driver if needed. It is recognized in developer side that the role of the systems will increase as SAE Level 2 systems become more common-place, and becomes more challenging at Level 3 and above to predict the driver\'s readiness for handover.|[102]|\n|\n|Vehicular communication|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Vehicular communication systems|\n|Vehicular communications is a growing area of communications between vehicles and including roadside communication infrastructure. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating |nodes| in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. This connectivity enables autonomous vehicles to interact with non-autonomous traffic and pedestrians to increase safety.|[103]|[104]|\nAnd autonomous vehicles will need to connect to the cloud to update their software and maps, and feedback information to improve the used maps and software of their manufacturer.|[91]|\n|\n|Re-programmable|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Over-the-air programming|\n|Autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle, meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this re-programmable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through |machine learning|, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software.\n|In March 2021, |UNECE| regulation on software update and software update management system was published.|[105]|\n|\n|Modularity|[|edit|]|\n|Autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n|\n|The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers;|\n|On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform;|\n|The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.;|\n|The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content\'s origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, Geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).|\n|Homogenization|[|edit|]|\n|In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Homogenization requires that the digital information from these different sources is transmitted and stored in the same form. This means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored, and computed in a way that the vehicles and their operating system can better understand and act upon it.\n|In international standardization field, |ISO|/TC 22 is in charge of in-vehicle transport information and control systems,|[106]| and ISO/TC 204 is in charge of information, communication and control systems in the field of urban and rural surface transportation.|[107]| International standards have been actively developed in the domains of AD/ADAS functions, connectivity, human interaction, in-vehicle systems, management/engineering, dynamic map and positioning, privacy and security.|[108]|\n|\n|Mathematical safety model|[|edit|]|\n|In 2017, |Mobileye| published a mathematical model for automated vehicle safety which is called "Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)".|[109]|\nIt is under standardization at |IEEE Standards Association| as "IEEE P2846: A Formal Model for Safety Considerations in Automated Vehicle Decision Making".|[110]|\n|In 2022, a research group of |National Institute of Informatics| (NII, Japan) expanded RSS and developed "Goal-Aware RSS" to make RSS rules possible to deal with complex scenarios via program logic.|[111]|\n|\n|Challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Obstacles|[|edit|]|\n|The potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability,|[112]|[113]| the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,|[114]| and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars,|[115]| concerns about safety,|[116]| and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.|[117]| In addition, cyberattacks could be a potential threat to autonomous driving in the future.|[118]|\n|Other obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,|[119]| ethical problems where an automated vehicle\'s software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action (the |trolley problem|),|[120]|[121]| concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed, the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location, association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and pattern-recognition AI, and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds, gestures and non-verbal cues by police, other drivers or pedestrians.|[122]|\n|\n| |Autonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another|\n|Possible technological obstacles for automated cars are:|[|needs update|]|\n|\n|Artificial intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner-city environments.|[123]|\n|A car\'s computer could potentially be compromised, as could a communication system between cars.|[124]|[125]|[126]|[127]|[128]|\n|Susceptibility of the car\'s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather (such as snow) or deliberate interference, including jamming and spoofing.|[122]|\n|Avoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking, and |Volvo| found that software suited to |caribou|, |deer|, and |elk| was ineffective with |kangaroos|.|[129]|\n|Autonomous cars may require |high-definition maps| to operate properly. Where these maps may be out of date, they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors.|\n|Competition for the radio spectrum desired for the car\'s communication.|[130]|\n|Field programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain.|[128]|\n|Current road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally.|[131]|\n|Validation challenge of Automated Driving and need for novel simulation-based approaches comprising digital twins and agent-based traffic simulation.|[132]|\n|Concerns|[|edit|]|\n|Regulation|In the 2010s, researchers openly worried about the potential of future regulation to delay deployment of automated cars on the road.|[133]| However, as written in |UNECE WP.29 GRVA|, international regulation for Level 3 was smoothly established in 2020, and the uncertainty was resolved. As of 2022|[update]|, in practice, it is actually very difficult to be approved as Level 3.\n|Deceptive marketing|\nAs Tesla\'s "Full Self-Driving (FSD)" actually corresponds to Level 2,|[134]| \nsenators called for investigation to the |Federal Trade Commission| (FTC) about their marketing claims in August 2021.|[135]|\nAnd in December 2021 in Japan, Mercedes-Benz Japan Co., Ltd. was punished by the |Consumer Affairs Agency| for the descriptions in their handouts that are different from the fact.|[136]|\n|In July 2016, following |a fatal crash by a Tesla car| operating in "Autopilot" mode, Mercedes-Benz was also slammed for a misleading commercial advertising |E-Class models| which had been available with "Drive Pilot".|[137]|\nAt that time, Mercedes-Benz rejected the claims and stopped its "self-driving car" ad campaign which had been running in the United States.|[138]|[139]|\nIn August 2022, the |California Department of Motor Vehicles| (DMV) accused Tesla of deceptive marketing  practices.|[140]|\n|Employment|\nCompanies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand.|[141]| As such, education and training by third-party organizations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community-driven projects such as DIY Robocars|[142]| and Formula Pi have quickly grown in popularity, while university level extra-curricular programmed such as Formula Student Driver-less|[143]| have bolstered graduate experience. Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources, such as code,|[144]| datasets|[145]| and glossaries|[146]| to widen the recruitment pool.\n|National security|\nIn the 2020s, from the importance of the automotive sector to the nation, self-driving car has become a topic of national security. The concerns regarding cybersecurity and data protection are not only important for user protection, but also in the context of national security. The trove of data collected by self-driving cars, paired with cybersecurity vulnerabilities, creates an appealing target for intelligence collection. Self-driving cars are required to be considered in a new way when it comes to espionage risk.|[147]|\n|It was in July 2018 that a former Apple engineer was arrested by |Federal Bureau of Investigation| (FBI) at |San Jose International Airport| (SJC) while preparing to board a flight to China and charged with stealing proprietary information related to Apple\'s self-driving car project.|[148]|[149]|\nAnd in January 2019, another Apple employee was charged with stealing self-driving car project secrets.|[150]|\nIn July 2021, |United States Department of Justice| (DOJ) accused Chinese security officials of a hacking attack seeking data on  of coordinating a vast hacking campaign to steal sensitive and secret information from government entities including research related to autonomous vehicles.|[151]|[152]|\nOn the China side, they have already prepared "the Provisions on Management of Automotive Data Security (Trial)".|[153]|[154]|\n|It is concerned that |leapfrogging| ability can be applied to autonomous car technology.|[155]|\nAlso, emerging |Cellular V2X| (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) technologies are based on |5G wireless networks|.|[156]|\nAs of November 2022|[update]|, |US Congress| is applying fresh scrutiny to the possibility that imported Chinese technology could be a Trojan horse.|[157]|\n|\n|Human factors|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Human factors and ergonomics|\n|Moving obstacles|\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of  behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.|[10]| Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. |Drive.ai| is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as "going now, don\'t cross" vs. "waiting for you to cross".|[158]|\n|Handover and risk compensation|\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handover from automated driving to manual driving.\nHuman factors research on automated systems has shown that people are slow to detect a problem with automation and slow to understand the problem after it is detected. When automation failures occur, unexpected transitions that require a driver to take over will occur suddenly and the driver may not be ready to take over.|[159]|\n|The second challenge is known as |risk compensation|: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier  behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of |Tesla Autopilot| ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n|Trust|\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.|[160]|[161]| Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.|[162]|[163]| There are three types of trust between human and automation.|[164]| There is dispositional trust, the trust between the driver and the company\'s product;|[164]| there is situational trust, or the trust from different scenarios;|[164]| and there is learned trust where the trust is built between similar events.|[164]|\n|\n|Moral issues|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Machine ethics|Rationale for liability|There are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt.|[165]| One study suggests requesting the owners of self-driving cars to sign end-user license agreements (EULAs), assigning to them accountability for any accidents.|[166]| Other studies suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.|[165]| Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.|[167]|\n|Implications from the Trolley Problem|A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software of a self-driving vehicle is captured in a variation of the traditional ethical thought experiment, the |trolley problem|: An AV is driving with passengers when suddenly a person appears in its way and the car has to commit between one of two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers.|[168]| Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the  behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: |deontology| and |utilitarianism|.|[10]|[169]| Deontological theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, promotes maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.|[10]|[169]| Recently, some specific ethical frameworks i.e., utilitarianism, deontology, relativism, absolutism (monism), and pluralism, are investigated empirically with respect to the acceptance of self-driving cars in unavoidable accidents.|[170]|\n|According to research, people overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas, that is, in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties.|[171]| While people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles, they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs.|[171]| This presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs.|[171]| People disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a self-driving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers.|[171]|\n|Bonnefon et al. concluded that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety.|[171]| This is because, if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in self-protective cars, it could prevent the large scale implementation of self-driving cars.|[171]| Delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives.|[171]|\n|Privacy|Privacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual (see |data mining|). This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car,  behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.|[172]|[173]|[174]| The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and |advanced analytics|.|[172]|\n|\n|Applications|[|edit|]|\n|Robotaxi|\n|\n|Main article: |Robotaxi|\n|Robotaxi is an application of self-driving car which is supposed to be operated by |taxi| company or |ridesharing company|. \nThrough the massive investments by |Big Tech| companies in the mid-2010s, research and development of robotaxi became active in the U.S.|[175]|\n|Self-driving shuttle and bus|\n|\n|Further information: |Vehicular automation §\xa0Shuttle|\n|Self-driving shuttle is an application of self-driving car with considerations of multiple passengers supposing the use cases mainly in cities. Through the |European Union| funded "CityMobil2" project in the mid-2010s, research and development of self-driving shuttle became active in Europe.|[176]|\nContinuously, under the funding programme |Horizon 2020|, "Avenue" project was conducted from 2018 to 2022 in four cities (|Geneva|, |Lyon|, |Copenhagen| and |Luxembourg|).|[177]|\n|Self-driving truck and van|\n|\n|Main article: |Self-driving truck|\n|Companies such as |Otto| and |Starsky Robotics| have focused on autonomous trucks. Automation of trucks is important, not only due to the improved safety aspects of these very heavy vehicles, but also due to the ability of fuel savings through |platooning|. Autonomous vans are being developed for use by |online grocers| such as |Ocado|.|[178]|\n|Autonomous micro-mobility|\nResearch has indicated that goods distribution on the macro (urban distribution) and micro level (|last mile delivery|) could be made more efficient with the use of autonomous vehicles|[179]| thanks to the possibility of smaller vehicle sizes.\nAlso, simulation studies in |MIT Media Lab| indicate that ultra-lightweight systems can become more helping to remove cars from our cities by applying autonomous driving technologies.|[180]|\n|In November 2022, |Honda| unveiled the "Honda CI Micro-mobility" machines and their core technologies. Honda starts demonstration testing using "Honda CI Micro-mobility" machines, "CiKoMa" and "WaPOCH", at two locations in |Jōsō| City of |Ibaraki Prefecture|.|[181]|\n|Autonomous work vehicle|\nIn 2021, Honda and |Black & Veatch| have successfully tested their second generation prototype  Autonomous Work Vehicle (AWV) at a Black & Veatch construction site in |New Mexico|.|[182]|\n|In December 2022, eve autonomy in Japan, a company backed by |Yamaha Motor| and TIER IV, launched the all-in-one autonomous transportation commercial service "eve auto" with EV work vehicle as the first SAE Level 4 service in Japan at nine sites, including Yamaha Motor\'s three factories, Prime Polymer\'s Anesaki Works, |Panasonic|\'s cold chain factory in the Oizumi area, |Fuji Electric|\'s Suzuka factory, Japan Logistic Systems Corp.\'s Ageo Center, and |ENEOS Corp.|\'s Negishi refinery.|[183]|\n|\n|Testing|[|edit|]|\n|Approaches|[|edit|]|\n|The testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically, in a closed environment|[184]| or, where permitted, on public roads (typically requiring a license or permit,|[185]| or adhering to a specific set of operating principles),|[186]| or in a virtual environment, i.e. using computer simulations.|[187]|[188]|\nWhen driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and "take over" when needed. For example, New York has strict requirements for the test driver, such that the vehicle can be corrected at all times by a licensed operator; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company\'s application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.|[189]|\n|\n|Disengagements in the 2010s|[|edit|]|\n| |A prototype of |Waymo|\'s self-driving car, navigating public streets in |Mountain View, California| in 2017|\n|In California, self-driving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to share how often their vehicles disengaged from autonomous mode during tests.|[190]|\nIt has been believed that we would learn how reliable the vehicles are becoming based on how often they needed "disengagements".|[191]|\n|In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545\xa0mi (567,366\xa0km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596\xa0mi (9,006\xa0km) between disengagements, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled a greater total distance than any of the other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000\xa0mi (1,600\xa0km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000\xa0mi (1,600\xa0km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of just 0.67\xa0mi (1.08\xa0km) per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, |Cruise| (now owned by |GM|) averaged 5,224\xa0mi (8,407\xa0km) per disengagement over a total distance of 62,689\xa0mi (100,888\xa0km).|[192]| In July 2018, the first electric driver-less racing car, "Robocar", completed a 1.8-kilometer track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.|[193]|\n|\n|\n|Distance between disengagement and total distance traveled autonomously in the 2010s\n|\n|\n|Car maker\n|\n|California, 2016|[192]|\n|\n|California, 2018|[194]|\n|\n|California, 2019|[195]|\n|\n|\n|Distance between|disengagements\n|\n|Total distance traveled\n|\n|Distance between|disengagements\n|\n|Total distance traveled\n|\n|Distance between|disengagements\n|\n|Total distance traveled\n|\n|\n|Waymo|\n|\n|5,128\xa0mi (8,253\xa0km)\n|\n|635,868\xa0mi (1,023,330\xa0km)\n|\n|11,154\xa0mi (17,951\xa0km)\n|\n|1,271,587\xa0mi (2,046,421\xa0km)\n|\n|11,017\xa0mi (17,730\xa0km)\n|\n|1,450,000\xa0mi (2,330,000\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|BMW|\n|\n|638\xa0mi (1,027\xa0km)\n|\n|638\xa0mi (1,027\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Nissan|\n|\n|263\xa0mi (423\xa0km)\n|\n|6,056\xa0mi (9,746\xa0km)\n|\n|210\xa0mi (340\xa0km)\n|\n|5,473\xa0mi (8,808\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Ford|\n|\n|197\xa0mi (317\xa0km)\n|\n|590\xa0mi (950\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|General Motors|\n|\n|55\xa0mi (89\xa0km)\n|\n|8,156\xa0mi (13,126\xa0km)\n|\n|5,205\xa0mi (8,377\xa0km)\n|\n|447,621\xa0mi (720,376\xa0km)\n|\n|12,221\xa0mi (19,668\xa0km)\n|\n|831,040\xa0mi (1,337,430\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Aptiv|\n|\n|15\xa0mi (24\xa0km)\n|\n|2,658\xa0mi (4,278\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Tesla|\n|\n|3\xa0mi (4.8\xa0km)\n|\n|550\xa0mi (890\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Mercedes-Benz|\n|\n|2\xa0mi (3.2\xa0km)\n|\n|673\xa0mi (1,083\xa0km)\n|\n|1.5\xa0mi (2.4\xa0km)\n|\n|1,749\xa0mi (2,815\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Bosch|\n|\n|7\xa0mi (11\xa0km)\n|\n|983\xa0mi (1,582\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Zoox|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,923\xa0mi (3,095\xa0km)\n|\n|30,764\xa0mi (49,510\xa0km)\n|\n|1,595\xa0mi (2,567\xa0km)\n|\n|67,015\xa0mi (107,850\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Nuro|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,028\xa0mi (1,654\xa0km)\n|\n|24,680\xa0mi (39,720\xa0km)\n|\n|2,022\xa0mi (3,254\xa0km)\n|\n|68,762\xa0mi (110,662\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Pony.ai|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,022\xa0mi (1,645\xa0km)\n|\n|16,356\xa0mi (26,322\xa0km)\n|\n|6,476\xa0mi (10,422\xa0km)\n|\n|174,845\xa0mi (281,386\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Baidu| (|Apolong|)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|206\xa0mi (332\xa0km)\n|\n|18,093\xa0mi (29,118\xa0km)\n|\n|18,050\xa0mi (29,050\xa0km)\n|\n|108,300\xa0mi (174,300\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Aurora|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|100\xa0mi (160\xa0km)\n|\n|32,858\xa0mi (52,880\xa0km)\n|\n|280\xa0mi (450\xa0km)\n|\n|39,729\xa0mi (63,938\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Apple|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1.1\xa0mi (1.8\xa0km)\n|\n|79,745\xa0mi (128,337\xa0km)\n|\n|118\xa0mi (190\xa0km)\n|\n|7,544\xa0mi (12,141\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Uber|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|0.4\xa0mi (0.64\xa0km)\n|\n|26,899\xa0mi (43,290\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|0\xa0mi (0\xa0km)\n|\n|In the 2020s|[|edit|]|\n|Disengagements|\nAs of 2022|[update]|, "disengagements" are at the center of the controversy. The problem is that reporting companies have varying definitions of what qualifies as a disengagement, and that definition can change over time.|[196]|[191]|\nExecutives of self-driving car companies have criticized disengagements as a deceptive metric, because it does not take into account the higher degree of difficulty navigating urban streets compared with interstates highway.|[197]|\n|Compliance|\nIn April 2021, |WP.29| GRVA issued the master document on "Test Method for Automated Driving (NATM)".|[198]|\n|In October 2021, the Europe\'s comprehensive pilot test of automated driving on public roads, L3Pilot, demonstrated automated systems for cars in |Hamburg|, Germany, in conjunction with |ITS World Congress 2021|. SAE Level 3 and 4 functions were tested on ordinary roads.|[199]|[200]|\nAt the end of February 2022, the final results of the L3Pilot project were published.|[201]|\n|In November 2022, an International Standard ISO 34502 on "Scenario based safety evaluation framework" was published.|[202]|[203]|\n|Collision avoidance|\nIn April 2022, collision avoidance testing was demonstrated by |Nissan|.|[204]|[205]|\nAlso, |Waymo| published a document about collision avoidance testing in December 2022.|[206]|\n|Simulation and validation|\nIn September 2022, Biprogy released a software system of "Driving Intelligence Validation Platform (DIVP)" as the achievement of Japanese national project "SIP-adus" led by |Cabinet Office| with the same name of its subproject which is interoperable with  Open Simulation Interface (OSI) of |ASAM|.|[207]|[208]|[209]|\n|Topics|\nIn November 2021, the |California Department of Motor Vehicles| (DMV) notified |Pony.ai| that it was suspending its driverless testing permit following a reported collision in Fremont on 28 October. This incident stands out because the vehicle was in autonomous mode and didn\'t involve any other vehicle.|[210]|\nIn May 2022, DMV revoked Pony.ai\'s permit for failing to monitor the driving records of the safety drivers on its testing permit.|[211]|\n|In April 2022, it is reported that |Cruise|\'s testing vehicle blocked |fire engine| on emergency call, and sparked questions about an autonomous vehicle\'s ability to handle unexpected roadway issues.|[212]|[213]|\n|In November 2022, |Toyota| gave a demonstration of one of |its GR Yaris| test car equipped with AI, which had been trained on the skills and knowledge of professional rally drivers to enhance the safety of self-driving cars.|[214]| Toyota has been using the learnings from the collaborative activities with |Microsoft| in FIA |World Rally Championship| since 2017 season.|[215]|\n|\n|Incidents|[|edit|]|\n|Tesla Autopilot|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Tesla Autopilot §\xa0Fatal crashes|\n|As of November\xa02021|[update]|, Tesla\'s |advanced driver-assistance system| (ADAS) Autopilot is classified as a Level 2.|[216]|\n|On 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China\'s Hubei province.|[217]| According to China\'s |163.com| news channel, this marked "China\'s first accidental death due to Tesla\'s automatic driving (system)". Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car\'s absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver\'s otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.|[218]|[219]| In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim\'s father documenting that fact.|[220]|\n|The second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in |Williston, Florida| on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S |electric car| was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel |tractor-trailer|. On 28 June 2016 the |US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration| (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the |Florida Highway Patrol|. According to NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck\'s trailer.|[221]|[222]| NHTSA\'s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.|[223]| On 8 July 2016, NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla\'s planned updates schedule for the next four months.|[224]|\n|According to Tesla, "neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied." The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, "with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S". Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla\'s first known autopilot death in over 130\xa0million miles (210\xa0million kilometers) driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94\xa0million miles (151\xa0million kilometers) among all type of vehicles in the US.|[221]|[222]|[225]| However, this number also includes fatalities of the crashes, for instance, of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians.|[226]|[227]|\n|In July 2016, the US |National Transportation Safety Board| (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said "It\'s worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible."|[228]| In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.|[229]|\n|In 2021, NTSB Chair called on Tesla to change the design of its Autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to the company\'s CEO.|[216]|\n|\n|Waymo|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Waymo §\xa0Crashes|\n| |Google\'s in-house |automated car|\n|Waymo originated as a self-driving car project within Google. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000\xa0km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.|[230]| In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated.|[231]| As of March\xa02016|[update]|, Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1,500,000\xa0mi (2,400,000\xa0km).|[232]| In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called |Alphabet|.|[233]|[234]|\n|According to Google\'s accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car\'s software caused a crash.|[235]|\n|In June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.|[236]| In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light. This was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries.|[237]| On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, "In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn\'t moved, there wouldn\'t have been a collision."|[238]|[239]| Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.|[235]|\n|\n|Uber\'s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG)|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Uber §\xa0Former operations|\n|In March 2018, |Elaine Herzberg| died after being hit by a self-driving car being tested by Uber\'s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) in the US state of Arizona. There was a safety driver in the car. Herzberg was crossing the road about 400 feet from an intersection.|[240]| This marks the first time an individual is known to have been killed by an autonomous vehicle, and the incident raised questions about regulation of the self-driving car industry.|[241]| Some experts said a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.|[242]| Arizona governor |Doug Ducey| suspended the company\'s ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an "unquestionable failure" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.|[243]| Uber then stopped self-driving tests in California until it was issued a new permit in 2020.|[244]|[245]|\n|In May 2018, the US |National Transportation Safety Board| (NTSB) issued a preliminary report.|[246]| The final report 18 months later determined that the immediate cause of the accident was the safety driver\'s failure to monitor the road because she was distracted by her phone. However, Uber ATG\'s "inadequate safety culture" contributed to the crash. The report noted from the post-mortem that the victim had "a very high level" of methamphetamine in her body.|[247]| The board also called on federal regulators to carry out a review before allowing automated test vehicles to operate on public roads.|[248]|[249]|\n|In September 2020, the backup driver, Rafael Vasquez, was charged with negligent homicide, because she did not look at the road for several seconds while her phone was streaming |The Voice| broadcast by |Hulu|. She pleaded not guilty and was released to await trial. Uber does not face any criminal charge because in the USA there is no basis for criminal liability for the corporation. The safety driver is assumed to be responsible of the accident, because she was in the driving seat in a capacity to avoid an accident (like in a Level 3). The trial was planned for February 2021.|[250]|[|needs update|]|\n|\n|Navya Arma driving system|[|edit|]|\n|On 9 November 2017, a |Navya| Arma automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply |defensive driving| techniques such as flashing its headlights, or sounding the horn. As one passenger commented, "The shuttle didn\'t have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still."|[251]|\n|\n|NIO Navigate on Pilot|[|edit|]|\n|On 12 August 2021, a 31-year-old Chinese man was killed after his |NIO ES8| collided with a construction vehicle.|[252]| NIO\'s self-driving feature is still in beta and cannot yet deal with static obstacles.|[253]| Though the vehicle\'s manual clearly states that the driver must take over when nearing construction sites, the issue is whether the feature was improperly marketed and unsafe. Lawyers of the deceased\'s family have also called into question NIO\'s private access to the vehicle, which they argue may lead to the data ending up forged.|[254]|\n|\n|Toyota e-Palette operation|[|edit|]|\n|On 26 August 2021, a |Toyota e-Palette|, a mobility vehicle used to support mobility within the Athletes\' Village at the Olympic and |Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020|, collided with a visually impaired pedestrian about to cross a pedestrian crossing.|[255]|\nThe suspension was made after the accident, and restarted on 31 with improved safety measures.|[256]|\n|\n|Public opinion surveys|[|edit|]|\n|In the 2010s|[|edit|]|\n|In a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by |Accenture|, 49% said they would be comfortable using a "driverless car".|[257]|\n|A 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by |J.D. Power and Associates| found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a "fully autonomous car". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.|[258]|\n|In a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.|[259]|\n|A 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by |Cisco Systems| found 57% "stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.|[260]|\n|In a 2014 US telephone survey by |Insurance.com|, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.|[261]|\n|In a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predicted that either |Tesla| or |Daimler| would be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler was predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.|[262]|\nIn 2015, a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.|[263]| The survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either "definitely" or "probably" interested in purchasing an automated car.|[263]|\n|In 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants\' age.|[264]|\n|In 2016, a |PwC| survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that "66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.|[265]|\n|In 2017, Pew Research Center surveyed 4,135 US adults from 1–15 May and found that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes—from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.|[266]|\n|In 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. A new standardized questionnaire, the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM) was developed, including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels. Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.|[267]|\n|\n|In the 2020s|[|edit|]|\n|In 2022, research by safety charity |Lloyd\'s Register Foundation| uncovered that only a quarter (27%) of the world\'s population would feel safe in self-driving cars.|[268]|\n|\n|Regulation|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Regulation of self-driving cars|\n|See also: |Regulation of algorithms|\n|Regulation of self-driving cars is an increasingly important issue which includes multiple subtopics. Among them are self-driving car liability, regulations regarding approval and international conventions.\n|\n|Anticipated launch|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Lane centering §\xa0Sample of level 2 automated cars|, and |List of self-driving system suppliers §\xa0Date of first public road driverless operation|\n|Between manually driven vehicles (SAE Level 0) and fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 5), there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of |automation|. These are collectively known as semi-automated vehicles. As it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure are developed for full automation, it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation. These semi-automated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles, while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle.|[269]|\n|\n|Anticipated Level 2|[|edit|]|\n|Tesla vehicles are equipped with hardware that Tesla claims will allow full self driving in the future. In October 2020 Tesla released a "|beta|" version of its "Full Self-Driving" software to a small group of testers in the United States;|[270]| however, this "Full Self-Driving" corresponds to level 2 autonomy.|[271]|\n|\n|Anticipated Level 3|[|edit|]|\n|In 2017, |BMW| had been trying to make |7 Series| as an automated car in public urban motorways of the United States, Germany and Israel before commercializing them in 2021.|[272]| Although it was not realized, BMW is still preparing 7 Series to become the next manufacturer to reach Level 3 in the second half of 2022.|[273]|[274]|\n|In September 2021, |Stellantis| has presented its findings from a pilot programme testing Level 3 autonomous vehicles on public Italian highways.\nStellantis\'s Highway Chauffeur claims Level 3 capabilities, which was tested on the |Maserati Ghibli| and |Fiat 500X| prototypes.|[275]|\nStellantis is going to roll out Level 3 capability within its cars in 2024.|[276]|\n|In January 2022, |Polestar|, a |Volvo Cars|\' brand, indicated its plan to offer Level 3 autonomous driving system in the Polestar 3 SUV, |Volvo XC90| successor, with technologies from |Luminar Technologies|, |Nvidia|, and Zenseact.|[277]|\n|As of February 2022|[update]|, |Hyundai Motor Company| is in the stage of enhancing cybersecurity of connected cars to put Level 3 self-driving |Genesis G90| on Korean roads.|[278]|\n|In December 2022, |Honda| announced that it will enhance its Level 3 technology to function at any speed below legal limits on highways by 2029.|[279]|[280]|\n|In early 2023, |Mercedes-Benz| plans to submit an application for its Level 3 Drive Pilot in California and Nevada for approval by mid-2023.|[281]|\n|\n|Anticipated Level 4|[|edit|]|\n|In July 2020, |Toyota| started testing with public demonstration rides on |Lexus LS| (fifth generation) based TRI-P4 with Level 4 capability.|[282]|\nIn August 2021, Toyota operated potentially Level 4 service using |e-Palette| around the |Tokyo 2020 Olympic| Village.|[283]|\n|In September 2020, |Mercedes-Benz| introduced world\'s first commercial Level 4 |Automated Valet Parking| (AVP) system named |Intelligent Park Pilot| for its new |S-Class|. The system can be pre-installed but is conditional on future national legal approval.|[284]|[285]|\n|In September 2021, |Honda| started testing programme toward launch of Level 4 mobility service business in Japan under collaboration with |Cruise| and |General Motors|, using Cruise AV.|[286]|\nIn October 2021 at |World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems|, Honda presented that they are already testing Level 4 technology on modified |Legend| Hybrid EX.|[287]| \nAt the end of the month, Honda explained that they are conducting verification project on Level 4 technology on a test course in |Tochigi prefecture|. Honda plans to test on public roads in early 2022.|[288]|\n|In February 2022, General Motors and Cruise have petitioned |NHTSA| for permission to build and deploy a self-driving vehicle, the Cruise Origin, which is without human controls like steering wheels or brake pedals. The car was developed with GM and Cruise investor Honda, and its production is expected to begin in late 2022 in |Detroit at GM\'s Factory Zero|.|[289]|[290]|\nAs of April 2022|[update]|, the petition is pending.|[291]|\n|In April 2022, Honda unveiled its Level 4 mobility service partners to roll out in central Tokyo in the mid-2020s using the Cruse Origin.|[292]|\nBy September 2022, Japan version prototype of Cruise Origin for Tokyo was completed and started testing.|[293]|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|\n|History of self-driving cars|\n|Self-driving car liability|\n|Self-driving truck|\n|Automotive navigation system|\n|Advanced driver-assistance system|\n|Computer vision|\n|Connected car|\n|DARPA Grand Challenge|: |2004|, |2005|, |2007|\n|DARPA Robotics Challenge| (2012)|\n|Dutch Automated Vehicle Initiative|\n|Death by GPS|\n|Driverless tractor|\n|Hybrid navigation|\n|Intelligent transportation system|\n|List of self-driving system suppliers|\n|Machine vision|\n|Mobility as a service|\n|Personal rapid transit|\n|Platoon (automobile)|\n|Retrofitting|\n|Smart camera|\n|Technological unemployment|\n|Unmanned ground vehicle|\n|Unmanned aerial vehicle|\n|Vehicle infrastructure integration|\n|Vehicle safety technology|\n|Vision processing unit|\n|Lane centering|\n|Measurement of Assured Clear Distance Ahead|\n|Electronic stability control|\n|Collision avoidance system|\n|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^ |a| |b| |Taeihagh, Araz; Lim, Hazel Si Min (2 January 2019).

A vehicle using automation for difficult tasks, especially navigation, to ease but not entirely replace human input, may be referred to as |semi-autonomous|, whereas a vehicle relying solely on automation is called |robotic| or |autonomous|.|[3]| Both of these types are instantiated in today\'s various |self-driving cars|, |unmanned surface vehicles|, |autonomous trains|, advanced airliner |autopilots|, |drone aircraft|, and |planetary rovers|, as well as guided |rockets| and |missiles|. After the invention of the |integrated circuit|, the sophistication of |automation| technology increased. Manufacturers and researchers subsequently added a variety of automated functions to automobiles and other vehicles. The technology involved in implementing autonomous vehicles is very expansive, ranging from technological improvements in the vehicle itself to the environment and objects around the vehicle. As the use of automated vehicles increases, they are becoming more influential in human lives. Although automated vehicles bring various benefits, they also come with various concerns. Also, there are still technological challenges that need to be overcome in order to make vehicular automation robust and scalable.|[4]|\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Overview|\n|2| |Autonomy levels|\n|3| |Technology used in vehicular automation|\n|4| |Success in the technology|\n|\n|4.1| |The SARTRE Project|\n|4.2| |Risks and liabilities|\n|\n|\n|5| |Challenges|\n|\n|5.1| |Technical challenges|\n|5.2| |Societal challenges|\n|5.3| |Regulatory challenges|\n|\n|\n|6| |Ground vehicles|\n|\n|6.1| |Cars|\n|6.2| |Shuttle|\n|\n|6.2.1| |Trials|\n|\n|\n|6.3| |Buses|\n|6.4| |Trucks|\n|\n|6.4.1| |Suppliers|\n|\n|\n|6.5| |Motorcycles|\n|6.6| |Trains|\n|6.7| |Trams|\n|6.8| |Automated guided vehicle|\n|\n|\n|7| |Aircraft|\n|\n|7.1| |Delivery drones|\n|\n|\n|8| |Watercraft|\n|\n|8.1| |Sea Machines|\n|8.2| |Buffalo Automation|\n|8.3| |Autonomous Marine Systems|\n|8.4| |Mayflower|\n|8.5| |Saildrones|\n|8.6| |DARPA|\n|\n|\n|9| |Submersibles|\n|10| |Assistance robots|\n|\n|10.1| |Spot|\n|\n|\n|11| |Highway Code change|\n|12| |Concerns|\n|\n|12.1| |Lack of control|\n|12.2| |Malfunctions|\n|12.3| |Ethical|\n|\n|\n|13| |See also|\n|14| |References|\n|15| |External links|\n|\n|\n|Overview|[|edit|]|\n| |Automated vehicle system technology hierarchy|\n|An automated driving system is generally an integrated package of individual |automated systems| operating in concert. Automated driving implies that the driver has delegated the ability to drive (i.e., all appropriate monitoring, agency, and action functions) to the vehicle automation system. Even though the driver may be alert and ready to take action at any moment, the automation system controls all functions.\n|Automated driving systems are often conditional, meaning that the automation system is capable of automated driving, but not for all conditions encountered in the course of normal operation.  Therefore, a human driver is functionally required to initiate the automated driving system, and may or may not do so when driving conditions are within the capability of the system. When the vehicle automation system has assumed all driving functions, the human is no longer driving the vehicle but continues to assume responsibility for the vehicle\'s performance as the vehicle operator. The automated vehicle operator is not functionally required to actively monitor the vehicle\'s performance while the automation system is engaged, but the operator must be available to resume driving within several seconds of being prompted to do so, as the system has limited conditions of automation. While the automated driving system is engaged, certain conditions may prevent real-time human input, but for no more than a few seconds. The operator is able to resume driving at any time subject to this short delay. When the operator has resumed all driving functions, he or she is the vehicle\'s driver again.\n|[5]| Fully autonomous cars and trucks that drive us instead of us driving them will become a reality. These self-driving vehicles ultimately will integrate onto U.S. roadways by progressing through six levels of driver assistance technology advancements in the coming years. This includes everything from no automation (where a fully engaged driver is required at all times), to full autonomy (where an automated vehicle operates independently, without a human driver).\n|An automated driving system is defined in an proposed amendment to  Article 1 of the |Vienna Convention on Road Traffic|:\n|\n|(ab) "|Automated driving system|" refers to a vehicle system that uses both hardware and\nsoftware to exercise dynamic control of a vehicle on a sustained basis.|(ac) "Dynamic control" refers to carrying out all the real-time operational and tactical functions required to move the vehicle. This includes controlling the vehicle’s lateral and longitudinal motion, monitoring the road environment, responding to events in the road traffic environment, and planning and signalling for manoeuvres.|[6]|\n|This amendment will enter into force on 14 July 2022, unless it is rejected before 13 January 2022.|[7]|\n|\n|An automated driving feature must be described sufficiently clearly so that it is distinguished from an assisted driving feature.|—\u2009|SMMT|[8]|\n|There are two clear states – a vehicle is either assisted with a driver being supported by technology or automated where the technology is effectively and safely replacing the driver.|—\u2009|SMMT|[8]|\n|Autonomy levels|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Self-driving_car §\xa0Classification|\n|Further information: |Automatic train operation §\xa0Types of train automation|\n|Autonomy in vehicles is often categorized in six levels:|[9]| The level system was developed by the |Society of Automotive Engineers| (SAE).|[10]|\n|\n|Level 0: No automation.|\n|Level 1: Driver assistance - The vehicle can control either steering or speed autonomously in specific circumstances to assist the driver.|\n|Level 2: Partial automation - The vehicle can control both steering and speed autonomously in specific circumstances to assist the driver.|\n|Level 3: Conditional automation - The vehicle can control both steering and speed autonomously under normal environmental conditions, but requires driver oversight.|\n|Level 4: High automation - The vehicle can complete travel autonomously under normal environmental conditions, not requiring driver oversight.|\n|Level 5: Full autonomy - The vehicle can complete travel autonomously in any environmental conditions.|\n|Level 0 refers, for instance, to vehicles which do not have |adaptive cruise control|.\n|Level 1 and 2 refer to vehicles where one part of the driving task is performed by the vehicle |advanced driver-assistance systems| (ADAS) under the responsibility/accountability/liability of the driver.\n|From level 3, the driver can conditionally transfer the driving task to the vehicle, but the driver must take back control when the conditional automation is no longer available. For instance an |automated traffic jam pilot| can drive in the |traffic jam| but the driver should take back control when traffic jam is over.\n|Level 5 refers to a vehicle which does not need any (human) driver.\n|"Level 2+" or "semi-automated" is a kind of enhanced level 2 where some manufacturers are ready to provide more features than the basic features of a level 2 system, but manufacturers and regulators are not yet ready for SAE level 3. This led to the introduction of the informal notion of "enhanced level 2" or "level 2+" or "semi-automated" — a dominant ADAS trend in 2021  —  which is a level 2 with additional safety and comfort. For instance, a low cost level 2+ vehicle can include interior-monitoring technologies to ensure driver attention, adaptive merging for when vehicles are entering or exiting the highway, and new kinds of enhanced |automatic emergency braking| (AEB) for pedestrian, cyclist and motorcyclist safety. Level 2+ can also include lane change and overtaking.|[11]|\n|The levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 - no automation; Level 1 - hands on/shared control; Level 2 - hands off; Level 3 - eyes off; Level 4 - mind off, and Level 5 - steering wheel optional.\n|As of December 2021|[update]|, level 3 remains a marginal portion of the market, with only one hundred level 3 |Honda Legend| cars available in the Japanese market.|[11]| It is possible that level 3 remains a marginal portion of the market until 2025.|[11]|\n|\n|Technology used in vehicular automation|[|edit|]|\n|The primary means of implementing autonomous vehicles is through the use of |Artificial Intelligence| (AI). In order for full autonomous vehicles to be implemented, the lower levels of automation must be thoroughly tested and implemented before moving on to the next level.|[12]| Through implementing autonomous systems, such as navigation, collision avoidance and steering, autonomous vehicle manufacturers work towards higher levels of autonomy by designing and implementing different systems of the car.|[12]| These autonomous systems, along with the use of artificial intelligence methods, can use the machine learning aspect of AI in order for the vehicle to control each of the other autonomous systems and processes. Thus, autonomous vehicle manufacturers are researching and developing appropriate AI specifically for autonomous vehicles.|[13]| While many of these companies are continuously developing technologies to be implemented into their autonomous vehicles, the general consensus is that the underlying technology is still in need of further development before fully autonomous vehicles are possible.|[14]|\n|Arguably one of the most important systems of any autonomous vehicle, the perception system must be fully developed and well-tested in order for autonomy to advance.|[14]| With the development and implementation of the perception system on autonomous vehicles, much of the safety standards of autonomous vehicles are being addressed by this system, which places an unequivocal emphasis on it to be flawless, as human lives would be subject to harm if a faulty system were to be developed.|[14]| The main purpose for the perception system is to constantly scan the surrounding environment and determine which objects in the environment pose a threat to vehicles.|[14]| In a sense, the perception system\'s main goal is to act like human perception, allowing the system to sense hazards and to prepare or correct for these hazards.|[14]| In terms of the detection part of the perception system, many solutions are being tested for accuracy and compatibility, such as |radar|, |lidar|, |sonar| and moving image processing.|[14]|\n|With the development of these autonomous subsystems of the car, autonomous vehicle manufacturers have already developed systems which act as assistance features on a vehicle. These systems are known as |advanced driver-assistance systems|, and contain systems to do such actions as parallel parking and emergency braking.|[13]| Along these systems, autonomous navigation systems play a role in the development of autonomous vehicles. In implementing the navigation system, there are two ways in which navigation can be implemented: sensing from one vehicle to another or sensing from the infrastructure.|[13]| These navigation systems would work in tandem with already well established navigation systems, such as the |Global Positioning System| (GPS), and be able to process route information, detecting such things as traffic jams, tolls and or road construction. From this information, the vehicle can then take the appropriate action to either avoid the area or plan accordingly.|[14]| However, there may be problems in using this method, such as outdated information, in which case vehicle to infrastructure communication can play a large role in constantly having up-to-date information.|[14]| An instance of this is having street signs and other regulatory markers display information to the vehicle, which allows the vehicle to make decisions based on the current information.|[14]|\n|Along with the development of autonomous vehicles, many of these vehicles are expected to be primarily electric, meaning that the main power source of the vehicle will be electric-based rather than fossil fuel-based.|[12]| Along with that, there comes the extra demand on autonomous vehicle manufacturers to produce higher quality electric cars in order to implement all the autonomous systems associated with the vehicle.|[15]| However, much of modern-day vehicle components can still be used in autonomous vehicles, such as the use of the automatic transmissions and operator protection equipment like airbags.|[15]|\n|In consideration of the development of autonomous vehicles, companies also are considering operator preferences and needs. These instances include allowing the user to minimize time, follow a precise route and accommodate any possible disabilities that the operator may have.|[16]| Along with accommodating the driver, autonomous vehicles also impose a technological factor onto the environment around it, generally needing a higher sense of connectivity in the vehicle\'s environment. With this new factor to consider, many urban governments are considering becoming a |smart city| in order to provide a sufficient foundation for autonomous vehicles.|[16]| Along these same lines of the vehicle\'s environment accommodating the vehicle, the user of these vehicles may also have to be technologically connected in order to operate these autonomous vehicles. With the advent of smartphones, it is predicted that autonomous vehicles will be able to have this connection with the user\'s smartphone or other technological devices similar to a smartphone.|[16]|\n|\n|Success in the technology|[|edit|]|\n|AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety| conducted a test of two automatic emergency braking systems: those designed to prevent crashes and others that aim to make a crash less severe. The test looked at popular models like the 2016 Volvo XC90, Subaru Legacy, Lincoln MKX, Honda Civic and Volkswagen Passat. Researchers tested how well each system stopped when approaching both a moving and nonmoving target. It found that systems capable of preventing crashes reduced vehicle speeds by twice that of the systems designed to merely mitigate crash severity. When the two test vehicles traveled within 30\xa0mph of each other, even those designed to simply lessen crash severity avoided crashes 60 percent of the time.|[17]|\n|The success in the automated driving system has been known to be successful in situations like rural road settings. Rural road settings would be a setting in which there is lower amounts of traffic and lower differentiation between driving abilities and types of drivers. "The greatest challenge in the development of automated functions is still inner-city traffic, where an extremely wide range of road users must be considered from all directions."|[18]| This technology is progressing to a more reliable way of the automated driving cars to switch from auto-mode to driver mode. |Auto-mode| is the mode that is set in order for the automated actions to take over, while the driver mode is the mode set in order to have the operator controlling all functions of the car and taking the responsibilities of operating the vehicle (Automated driving system not engaged).\n|This definition would include vehicle automation systems that may be available in the near term—such as traffic-jam assist, or full-range automated cruise control—if such systems would be designed such that the human operator can reasonably divert attention (monitoring) away from the performance of the vehicle while the automation system is engaged. This definition would also include automated platooning (such as conceptualized by the SARTRE project).\n|\n|The SARTRE Project|[|edit|]|\n|The |SARTRE| project\'s main goal is to create platooning, a train of automated cars, that will provide comfort and have the ability for the driver of the vehicle to arrive safely to a destination. Along with the ability to be along the train, drivers that are driving past these platoons, can join in with a simple activation of the automated driving system that correlates with a truck that leads the platoon. The |SARTRE| project is taking what we know as a train system and mixing it with automated driving technology. This is intended to allow for an easier transportation through cities and ultimately help with traffic flow through heavy automobile traffic.\n|In some parts of the world the self-driving car has been tested in real life situations such as in Pittsburgh.|[19]| |The Self-driving Uber| has been put to the test around the city, driving with different types of drivers as well as different traffic situations. Not only have there been testing and successful parts to the automated car, but there has also been extensive testing in California on automated busses. The lateral control of the automated buses uses magnetic markers such as the platoon at San Diego, while the longitudinal control of the automated truck platoon uses millimeter wave radio and radar. Current examples around today\'s society include the |Google car| and |Tesla|\'s models. |Tesla| has redesigned automated driving, they have created car models that allow drivers to put in the destination and let the car take over.  These are two modern day examples of the automated driving system cars.\n|\n|Risks and liabilities|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Computer security §\xa0Automobiles|, and |Autonomous car liability|\n|Many automakers such as |Ford| and |Volvo| have announced plans to offer fully automated cars in the future.|[20]| Extensive research and development is being put into automated driving systems, but the biggest problem automakers cannot control is how drivers will use system.|[20]| Drivers are stressed to stay attentive and safety warnings are implemented to alert the driver when corrective action is needed.|[21]| |Tesla Motor|\'s has one recorded incident that resulted in a fatality involving the automated driving system in the Tesla Model S.|[22]| The accident report reveals the accident was a result of the driver being inattentive and the autopilot system not recognizing the obstruction ahead.|[22]|\n|Another flaw with automated driving systems is that in situations where unpredictable events such as weather or the driving behavior of others may cause fatal accidents due to sensors that monitor the surroundings of the vehicle not being able to provide corrective action.|[21]|\n|To overcome some of the challenges for automated driving systems, novel methodologies based on virtual testing, traffic flow simulation and digital prototypes have been proposed,|[23]| especially when novel algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence approaches are employed which require extensive training and validation data sets.\n|The implementation of automated driving systems poses the possibility of changing build environments in urban areas, such as the expansion of suburban areas due to the increased ease of mobility.|[12]|\n|\n|Challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Around 2015, several self-driving car companies including Nissan and Toyota promised self-driving cars by 2020. However, the predictions turned out to be far too optimistic.|[24]|\n|There are still many obstacles in developing fully autonomous Level 5 vehicles, which is able to operate in any conditions. Currently, companies are focused on Level 4 automation, which is able to operate under certain environmental circumstances.|[24]|\n|There is still debate about what an autonomous vehicle should look like. For example, whether to incorporate lidar to autonomous driving systems is still being argued. Some researchers have come up with algorithms utilizing camera-only data that achieve the performance that rival those of lidar. On the other hand, camera-only data sometimes draw inaccurate bounding boxes, and thus lead to poor predictions. This is due to the nature of superficial information that |stereo cameras| provide, whereas incorporating lidar gives autonomous vehicles precise distance to each point on the vehicle.|[24]|\n|\n|Technical challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Software Integration: Because of the large number of sensors and safety processes required by autonomous vehicles, software integration remains a challenging task. A robust autonomous vehicle should ensure that the integration of hardware and software can recover from component failures.|[25]|\n|Prediction and trust among autonomous vehicles: Fully autonomous cars should be able to anticipate the actions of other cars like humans do. Human drivers are great at predicting other drivers\' behaviors, even with a small amount of data such as eye contact or hand gestures. In the first place, the cars should agree on traffic rules, whose turn it is to drive in an intersection, and so on. This scales into a larger issue when there exists both human-operated cars and self-driving cars due to more uncertainties. A robust autonomous vehicle is expected to improve on understanding the environment better to address this issue.|[25]|\n|Scaling up: The coverage of autonomous vehicles testing could not be accurate enough. In cases where heavy traffic and obstruction exist, it requires faster response time or better tracking algorithms from the autonomous vehicles. In cases where unseen objects are encountered, it\'s important that the algorithms are able to track these objects and avoid collisions.|[25]|\n|Societal challenges|[|edit|]|\n|One critical step to achieve the implementation of autonomous vehicles is the acceptance by the general public. It is an important ongoing research because it provides guidelines for the automobile industry to improve their design and technology. Studies have shown that many people believe that using autonomous vehicles is safer, which underlines the necessity for the automobile companies to assure that autonomous vehicles improve safety benefits. The TAM research model breaks down important factors that affect the consumer\'s acceptance into: usefulness, ease to use, trust, and social influence.|[26]|\n|\n|The usefulness factor studies whether or not autonomous vehicles are useful in that they provide benefits that save consumers\' time and make their lives simpler. How well the consumers believe autonomous vehicles will be useful compared to other forms of transportation solutions is a determining factor.|[26]|\n|The ease to use factor studies the user-friendliness of the autonomous vehicles. While the notion that consumers care more about ease to use than safety has been challenged, it still remains an important factor that has indirect effects on the public\'s intention to use autonomous vehicles.|[26]|\n|The trust factor studies the safety, data privacy and security protection of autonomous vehicles. A more trusted system has a positive impact on the consumer\'s decision to use autonomous vehicles.|[26]|\n|The social influence factor studies whether the influence of others would influence consumer\'s likelihood of having autonomous vehicles. Studies have shown that the social influence factor is positively related to behavioral intention. This might be due to the fact that cars traditionally serve as a status symbol that represents one\'s intent to use and his social environment.|[26]|\n|Regulatory challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Real-time testing of autonomous vehicles is an inevitable part of the process.\xa0At the same time, vehicular automation regulators are faced with challenges to protect public safety and yet allow autonomous vehicle companies to test their products. Groups representing autonomous vehicle companies are resisting most regulations, whereas groups representing vulnerable road users and traffic safety are pushing for regulatory barriers. To improve traffic safety, the regulators are encouraged to find a middle ground that protects the public from immature technology while allowing autonomous vehicle companies to test the implementation of their systems.|[27]| There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety regulatory knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics.|[28]|\n|\n|Ground vehicles|[|edit|]|\n|Further information: |Unmanned ground vehicle|\n|Ground vehicles employing automation and |teleoperation| include shipyard gantries, mining trucks, bomb-disposal robots, robotic insects, and |driverless tractors|.\n|There are a lot of autonomous and semi-autonomous ground vehicles being made for the purpose of transporting passengers. One such example is the free-ranging on grid (|FROG|) technology which consists of autonomous vehicles, a magnetic track and a supervisory system. The FROG system is deployed for industrial purposes in factory sites and has been in use since 1999 on the |ParkShuttle|, a |PRT|-style public transport system in the city of |Capelle aan den IJssel| to connect the Rivium business park with the neighboring city of |Rotterdam| (where the route terminates at the |Kralingse Zoom| metro station). The system experienced a crash in 2005|[29]| that proved to be caused by a human error.|[30]|\n|Applications for automation in ground vehicles include the following:\n|\n|Vehicle tracking system| system ESITrack, |Lojack|\n|Rear-view alarm, to detect obstacles behind.|\n|Anti-lock braking system| (ABS) (also Emergency Braking Assistance (|EBA|)), often coupled with |Electronic brake force distribution| (EBD), which prevents the brakes from locking and losing traction while braking. This shortens stopping distances in most cases and, more importantly, allows the driver to steer the vehicle while braking.|\n|Traction control system| (TCS) actuates brakes or reduces throttle to restore traction if driven wheels begin to spin.|\n|Four wheel drive| (AWD) with a centre differential. Distributing power to all four wheels lessens the chances of wheel spin. It also suffers less from |oversteer| and |understeer|.|\n|Electronic Stability Control| (ESC) (also known for |Mercedes-Benz| proprietary Electronic Stability Program (ESP), |Acceleration Slip Regulation| (ASR) and Electronic differential lock (EDL)). Uses various sensors to intervene when the car senses a possible loss of control. The car\'s control unit can reduce power from the engine and even apply the brakes on individual wheels to prevent the car from |understeering| or |oversteering|.|\n|Dynamic steering response| (DSR) corrects the rate of |power steering| system to adapt it to vehicle\'s speed and road conditions.|\n|Research is ongoing and prototypes of autonomous ground vehicles exist.\n|\n|Cars|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Self-driving car|\n|Extensive automation for cars focuses on either introducing |robotic cars| or modifying modern car designs to be semi-autonomous.\n|Semi-autonomous designs could be implemented sooner as they rely less on technology that is still at the forefront of research. An example is the dual mode monorail. Groups such as |RUF| (Denmark) and TriTrack (USA) are working on projects consisting of specialized private cars that are driven manually on normal roads but also that dock onto a monorail/guideway along which they are driven autonomously.\n|As a method of automating cars without extensively modifying the cars as much as a |robotic car|, |Automated highway systems| (AHS) aims to construct lanes on highways that would be equipped with, for example, magnets to guide the vehicles. Automation vehicles have auto-brakes named as Auto Vehicles Braking System (AVBS). Highway computers would manage the traffic and direct the cars to avoid crashes.\n|In 2006, The |European Commission| has established a smart car development program called the |Intelligent Car Flagship Initiative|.|[31]|  The goals of that program include:\n|\n|Adaptive cruise control|\n|Lane departure warning system|\n|Project AWAKE for drowsy drivers|\n|There are plenty of further uses for automation in relation to cars. These include:\n|\n|Assured Clear Distance Ahead|\n|Adaptive headlamps|\n|Advanced Automatic Collision Notification|, such as |OnStar|\n|Intelligent Parking Assist System|\n|Automatic Parking|\n|Automotive night vision| with pedestrian detection|\n|Blind spot monitoring|\n|Driver Monitoring System|\n|Robotic car| or self-driving car which may result in less-stressed "drivers", higher efficiency (the driver can do something else), increased safety and less |pollution| (e.g. via completely automated |fuel| control)|\n|Precrash system|\n|Safe speed governing|\n|Traffic sign recognition|\n|Following another car on a motorway – "enhanced" or "adaptive" cruise control, as used by Ford and Vauxhall|[32]|\n|Distance control assist – as developed by Nissan|[33]|\n|Dead man\'s switch| – there is a move to introduce |deadman\'s braking| into automotive application, primarily heavy vehicles, and there may also be a need to add |penalty switches| to |cruise controls|.|\n|Singapore also announced a set of provisional national standards on January 31, 2019, to guide the autonomous vehicle industry. The standards, known as Technical Reference 68 (TR68), will promote the safe deployment of fully driverless vehicles in Singapore, according to a joint press release by Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Land Transport Authority (LTA), Standards Development Organisation and Singapore Standards Council (SSC).|[34]|\n|\n|Shuttle|[|edit|]|\n| |Parkshuttle|\n| |Navya Autonom Shuttle|\n| |Easymile EZ10|\n|Since 1999, the 12-seat/10-standing |ParkShuttle| has been operating on an 1.8 kilometres (1.1\xa0mi) exclusive right of way in the city of |Capelle aan den IJssel| in The Netherlands. The system uses small magnets in the road surface to allow the vehicle to determine its position.  The use of shared autonomous vehicles was trialed around 2012 in a hospital car park in Portugal.|[35]|  From 2012 to 2016 the |European Union| funded CityMobil2 project examined the use of shared autonomous vehicles and passenger experience including short term trials in seven cities. This project led to the development of the EasyMile EZ10.|[36]|\n|In the 2010s, self-driving shuttle became able to run in mixed traffic without the need for embedded guidance markers.|[37]|  So far the focus has been on low speed, 20 miles per hour (32\xa0km/h), with short, fixed routes for the "last mile" of journeys.  This means issues of collision avoidance and safety are significantly less challenging than those for automated cars, which seek to match the performance of conventional vehicles.  Many trials have been undertaken, mainly on quiet roads with little traffic or on public pathways or private roadways and specialised test sites.|[|citation needed|]|  The capacity of different models varies significantly, between 6-seats and 20-seats.  (Above this size there are conventional buses that have driverless technology installed.)\n|In December 2016, the |Jacksonville Transportation Authority| has announced its intention to replace the |Jacksonville Skyway| monorail with driverless vehicles that would run on the existing elevated superstructure as well as continue onto ordinary roads.|[38]|  The project has since been named the "Ultimate Urban Circulator" or "U2C" and testing has been carried out on shuttles from six different manufacturers.  The cost of the project is estimated at $379 million.|[39]|\n|In January 2017, it was announced the |ParkShuttle| system in the Netherlands will be renewed and expanded including extending the route network beyond the exclusive right of way so vehicles will run in mixed traffic on ordinary roads.|[40]|  The plans were delayed and the extension into mixed traffic is now expected in 2021.|[41]|\n|In July 2018, |Baidu| stated it had built 100 of its 8-seat |Apolong| model, with plans for commercial sales.|[42]| As of July 2021 they have not gone into volume production.\n|In August 2020, it was reported there were 25 autonomous shuttle manufacturers,|[43]| including the |2GetThere|, |Local Motors|, |Navya|, |Baidu|, |Easymile|, |Toyota| and Ohmio.\n|In December 2020, |Toyota| showcased it\'s 20-passenger "e-Palette" vehicle, which is due to be used at the |2021 Tokyo Olympic Games|.|[44]|  Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.|[45]|\n|In January 2021, Navya released an investor report which predicted global autonomous shuttle sales will reach 12,600 units by 2025, with a market value of EUR 1.7 billion.|[46]|\n|In June 2021, Chinese maker |Yutong| claimed to have delivered 100 models of its 10-seat Xiaoyu 2.0 autonomous bus for use in |Zhengzhou|.  Testing has been carried out in a number of cities since 2019 with trials open to the public due to commence in July 2021.|[47]|\n|Self-driving shuttles are already in use on some private roads, such as at the Yutong factory in Zhengzhou where they are used to transport workers between buildings of the world\'s largest bus factory.|[48]|\n|\n|Trials|[|edit|]|\n|A large number of trials have been conducted since 2016, with most involving only one vehicle on a short route for a short period of time and with an onboard conductor.  The purpose of the trials has been to both provide technical data and to familiarize the public with the driverless technology. A 2021 survey of over 100 shuttle experiments across Europe concluded that low speed - 15–20 kilometres per hour (9.3–12.4\xa0mph) - was the major the barrier to implementation of autonomous shuttle buses.  The current cost of the vehicles at €280,000 and the need for onboard attendants were also issues.|[49]|\n|\n|This list is |incomplete|; you can help by |adding missing items|.  |(|November 2021|)|\n|\n|\n|Company/Location|\n|Details\n|\n|\n|Navya| "Arma" in |Neuhausen am Rheinfall|\n|\n|In October 2016, BestMile started trials  in |Neuhausen am Rheinfall|, claiming to be the world\'s first solution for managing hybrid fleets with both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles.|[50]| And the test ended in October 2021.|[51]|\n|\n|\n|Local Motors "Olli"|\n|\n|At the end of 2016, the Olli was tested in |Washington D.C.|[52]|  In 2020, a four month trial was undertaken at the United Nations |ITCILO| campus in |Turin, Italy| to provide transport shuttle to employees and guests within the campus.|[53]|\n|\n|\n|Navya "Autonom"|\n|Navya claimed in May 2017 to have carried almost 150,000 passengers across Europe|[54]| with trials in |Sion|, |Cologne|, |Doha|, |Bordeaux| and the nuclear power plant at |Civaux| as well as |Las Vegas|[55]| and |Perth|.|[56]|  Ongoing public trials are underway in |Lyon|, |Val Thorens| and |Masdar City|.

At the same time, some companies like Starsky, are aiming for Level 3 Autonomy, which would see the driver playing a control role around the truck\'s environment. The company\'s project, remote truck driving, would give truck drivers a greater work-life balance, enabling them to avoid long periods away from their home. This would however provoke a potential mismatch between the driver\'s skills with the technological redefinition of the job.\n|Companies that buy driverless trucks could massively cut down on costs: human drivers will no longer be required, companies\' liabilities due to truck accidents will diminish, and productivity will increase (as the driverless truck doesn\'t need to rest). The usage of self driving trucks will go hand in hand with the use of real-time data to optimize both efficiency and productivity of the service delivered, as a way to tackle traffic congestion for example. Driverless trucks could enable new business models that would see deliveries shift from day time to night time or time slots in which traffic is less heavily dense.\n|\n|Suppliers|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|Company|\n|Details\n|\n|\n|Waymo Semi|\n|In March 2018, |Waymo|, the automated vehicle company spun off from |Google| parent company |Alphabet Inc.|, announced it was applying its technology to semi trucks. In the announcement, Waymo noted it would be using automated trucks to move freight related to Google\'s data centers in the |Atlanta|, GA area. The trucks will be manned and operated on public roads.|[113]|\n|\n|\n|Uber Semi|\n|In October 2016, |Uber| completed the first driverless operation of an automated truck on public roads, delivering a trailer of |Budweiser| beer from Fort Collins, CO to Colorado Springs.|[114]| The run was completed at night on Interstate 25 after extensive testing and system improvements in cooperation with the Colorado State Police. The truck had a human in the cab but not sitting in the driver\'s seat, while the Colorado State Police provided a rolling closure of the highway.|[115]| At the time, Uber\'s automated truck was based primarily on technology developed by |Otto|, which Uber acquired in August 2016.|[116]| In March 2018, Uber announced it was using its automated trucks to deliver freight in Arizona, while also leveraging the UberFreight app to find and dispatch loads.|[117]|\n|\n|\n|Embark Semi|\n|\n|In February 2018, Embark Trucks announced it had completed the first cross-country trip of an automated semi, driving 2,400 miles from Los Angeles, CA to Jacksonville, FL on Interstate 10.|[118]| This followed a November 2017 announcement that it had partnered with |Electrolux| and |Ryder| to test its automated truck by moving |Frigidaire| refrigerators from El Paso, TX to Palm Springs, CA.|[119]|\n|\n|\n|\n|Tesla Semi|\n|\n|In November 2017 |Tesla, Inc.|, owned by |Elon Musk|, revealed a prototype of the |Tesla Semi| and announced that it would go into production. This long-haul, electric semi-truck can drive itself and move in "platoons" that automatically follow a lead vehicle.  It was disclosed in August 2017 that it sought permission to test the vehicles in |Nevada|.|[120]|\n|\n|\n|\n|Starsky Robotics|\n|In 2017, |Starsky Robotics| unveiled its technology that allows to make trucks autonomous. Unlike its bigger competitors in this industry that aims to tackle Level 4 and 5 Autonomy, Starsky Robotics is aiming at producing Level 3 Autonomy trucks, in which the human drivers should be prepared to respond to a "request to intervene" in case anything goes wrong.\n|\n|\n|Pronto AI|\n|\n|In December 2018, |Anthony Levandowski| unveiled his new autonomous driving company, Pronto, which is building L2 ADAS technology for the commercial trucking industry. The company is based in San Francisco.|[121]|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Motorcycles|[|edit|]|\n|Several self-balancing autonomous motorcycles were demonstrated in 2017 and 2018 from BMW, Honda and Yamaha.|[122]|[123]|[124]|\n|\n|This list is |incomplete|; you can help by |adding missing items|.  |(|June 2021|)|\n|\n|\n|Company/Location|\n|Details\n|\n|\n|Honda motorcycle|\n|Inspired by the Uni-cub, Honda implemented their self-balancing technology into their motorcycles. Due to the weight of motorcycles, it is often a challenge for motorcycle owners to keep balance of their vehicles at low speeds or at a stop. Honda\'s motorcycle concept has a self-balancing feature that will keep the vehicle upright. It automatically lowers the center of balance by extending the wheelbase. It then takes control of the steering to keep the vehicle balanced. This allows users to navigate the vehicle more easily when walking or driving in stop and go traffic. However, this system is not for high speed driving.\xa0|[122]|[125]|\n|\n|\n|BMWs Motorrad Vision concept motorcycle|\n|BMW Motorrad developed the ConnectRide self driving motorcycle in order to push the boundaries of motorcycle safety. The autonomous features of the motorcycle include emergency braking, negotiating intersections, assisting during tight turns, and front impact avoidance. These are features similar to current technologies that are being developed and implemented in autonomous cars. This motorcycle can also fully drive on its own at normal driving speed, making turns and returning to a designated location. It lacks the self standing feature that Honda has implemented.|[126]|\n|\n|\n|Yamaha’s riderless motorcycle|\n|“Motoroid” can hold its balance, autonomous driving, recognizing riders and going to a designated location with a hand gesture. Yamaha utilized the “Human beings react a hell of a lot quicker” research philosophy into the motoroid. The idea is that the autonomous vehicle is not attempting to replace human beings, but to augment the abilities of the human with advanced technology. They have tactile feedback such as a gentle squeeze to a rider\'s lower back as a reassuring caress at dangerous speeds, as if the vehicle was responding and communicating with the rider. Their goal is to “meld” the machine and human together to form one experience.|[127]|\n|\n|\n|Harley-Davidson|\n|While their motorcycles are popular, one of the largest problems of owning a Harley-Davidson is the reliability of the vehicle. It is difficult to manage the weight of the vehicle at low speeds and picking it up from the ground can be a difficult process even with correct techniques. In order to attract more customers, they filed a patent for having a gyroscope at the back of the vehicle that will keep the balance of the motorcycle for the rider at low speeds. After 3 miles per hour, the system disengages. However anything below that, the gyroscope can handle the balance of the vehicle which means it can balance even at a stop. This system can be removed if the rider feels ready without it (meaning it is modular).|[125]|\n|\n|Trains|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Automatic train operation|\n|The concept for autonomous vehicles has also been applied for commercial uses, like for autonomous trains. The world\'s first driverless urban transit system is the |Port Island Line| in |Kobe|, Japan, opened in 1981.|[128]| The first self-driving train in the UK was launched in London on the Thameslink route.|[129]|\n|An example of an automated train network is the |Docklands Light Railway| in |London|.\n|Also see |List of automated train systems|.\n|\n|Trams|[|edit|]|\n|In 2018 the first autonomous |trams in Potsdam| were trialed.|[130]|\n|\n|Automated guided vehicle|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Automated guided vehicle|\n|An automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle (AGV) is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision, magnets, or lasers for navigation. They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or warehouse. Application of the automatic guided vehicle has broadened during the late 20th century.\n|\n|Aircraft|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Unmanned aerial vehicle|\n|Aircraft has received much attention for automation, especially for navigation. A system capable of autonomously navigating a vehicle (especially aircraft) is known as |autopilot|.\n|\n|Delivery drones|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Delivery drone|\n|Various industries such as packages and food experimented with delivery drones. Traditional and new transportation companies are competing in the market. For example, |UPS Flight Forward|, Alphabet Wing, and |Amazon Prime Air| are all developing delivery drones.|[131]| |Zipline|, an American medical drone delivery company, has the largest active drone delivery operations in the world, and its drones are capable of Level 4 autonomy.|[132]|\n|However, even if technology seems to allow for those solutions to function correctly as various tests of various companies show, the main throwback to the market launch and use of such drones is inevitably the legislation in place and regulatory agencies have to decide on the framework they wish to take to draft regulation. This process is in different phases across the world as each country will tackle the topic independently. For example, Iceland\'s government and departments of transport, aviation, police have already started issuing licenses for drone operations. It has a permissive approach and together with Costa Rica, Italy, the UAE, Sweden and Norway, has a fairly unrestricted legislation on commercial drone use. Those countries are characterized by a body of regulation that may give operational guidelines or require licensing, registration and insurance.|[133]|\n|On the other side, other countries have decided to ban, either directly (outright ban) or indirectly (effective ban), the use of commercial drones. The RAND Corporation thus makes the difference between countries forbidding drones and those that  have a formal process for commercial drone licensing, but requirements are either impossible to meet or licenses do not appear to have been approved. In the US, UPS is the only one with the Part 135 Standard certification that is required to use drones to deliver to real customers.|[131]|\n|However, most countries seem to be struggling on the integration of drones for commercial uses into their aviation regulatory frameworks. Thus, constraints are placed on the use of those drones such as that they must be operating within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the pilot and thus limiting their potential range. This would be the case of the Netherlands and Belgium. Most countries do let pilot operate outside the VLOS but is subject to restrictions and pilot ratings, which would be the case of the US.\n|The general trend is that legislation is moving fast and laws are constantly being reevaluated. Countries are moving towards a more permissive approach but the industry still lacks infrastructures to ensure the success of such a transition. To provide safety and efficiency, specialized training courses, pilot exams (type of UAV and flying conditions) as well as liability management measures regarding insurances have to be developed.\n|There is a sense of urgency that breathes from this innovation as competition is high and companies lobby to integrate them rapidly in their products and services offerings. Since June 2017, the US Senate legislation reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation to create a carrier certificate allowing for package deliveries by drones.|[134]|\n|\n|Watercraft|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Unmanned surface vehicle|\n|Autonomous boats can provide security, do research, or perform hazardous or repetitive tasks (such as guiding a large ship into a harbor or transporting cargo).\n|\n|Sea Machines|[|edit|]|\n|Sea Machines offers an autonomous system for workboats. While it does require a human operator to oversee its actions, the system takes care of a lot of active domain perception and navigation duties that normally a few members of the crew would have to do. They use AI to have situational awareness for different ships within the route. They utilize camera, lidar, and proprietary software to inform the operator of its status.|[135]|[136]|\n|\n|Buffalo Automation|[|edit|]|\n|Buffalo Automation|, a team formed from the University of Buffalo, creates technology for semi-autonomous features for boats. They started out creating navigation assist technologies for freighters called AutoMate, which is like having another very experienced “first mate” that will look out for the ship.|[137]| The system helps make twists and turns of difficult waterways.|[136]|[138]|\n|\n|Autonomous Marine Systems|[|edit|]|\n|This Massachusetts based company has led the forefront of unmanned sailing drones. The Datamarans are out autonomously sailing around to collect ocean data. They are created to enable large payload packages. Due to the automated system and their solar panels, they are able to navigate for longer periods of time. More than anything they boast their technologies on advanced metocean surveys which collect “wind velocity profiles with altitude, water current, conductivity, temperature profiles with depth, hi-resolution bathymetry, sub-bottom profiling, magnetometer measurements” |[139]|[136]|\n|\n|Mayflower|[|edit|]|\n|The autonomous vessel called Mayflower is expected to be the first large ship that makes an unmanned transatlantic journey.|[140]|\n|\n|Saildrones|[|edit|]|\n|This autonomous unmanned vessel uses both solar and wind energy to navigate.|[141]|\n|\n|DARPA|[|edit|]|\n|Sea Hunter| is an |autonomous| |unmanned surface vehicle| (USV) launched in 2016 as part of the |DARPA| |Anti-Submarine Warfare| Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (|ACTUV|) program.\n|\n|Submersibles|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Autonomous underwater vehicle|\n|Underwater vehicles have been a focus for automation for tasks such as pipeline inspection and underwater mapping.\n|\n|Assistance robots|[|edit|]|\n|Spot|[|edit|]|\n|This robot is a four-legged nimble robot that was created to be able to navigate through many different terrain outdoors and indoors. It can walk on its own without colliding into anything. It utilizes many different sensors, including 360 vision cameras and gyroscopes. It is able to keep its balance even when pushed over. This vehicle, while it is not intended to be ridden, can carry heavy loads for construction workers or military personnel through rough terrain.|[142]|\n|\n|Highway Code change|[|edit|]|\n|The UK considers the way to update its british Highway Code for automated code:\n|\n|Automated vehicles can perform all the tasks involved in driving, in at least some situations. They differ from vehicles fitted with assisted driving features (like |cruise control| and |lane-keeping assistance|), which carry out some tasks, but where the driver is still responsible for driving. If you are driving a vehicle with assisted driving features, you MUST stay in control of the vehicle.|—\u2009|proposed changes to The Highway Code|[143]|\n|If the vehicle is designed to require you to resume driving after being prompted to, while the vehicle is driving itself, you MUST remain in a position to be able to take control. For example, you should not move out of the driving seat. You should not be so distracted that you cannot take back control when prompted by the vehicle.|—\u2009|proposed changes to The Highway Code|[143]|\n|Concerns|[|edit|]|\n|Lack of control|[|edit|]|\n|Through the autonomy level, it is shown that the higher the level of autonomy, the fewer control humans have on their vehicles (highest level of autonomy needing zero human interventions). One of the few concerns regarding the development of vehicular automation is related to the end-users’ trust in the technology that controls automated vehicles.|[144]| According to a nationally conducted survey made by |Kelley Blue Book| (KBB) in 2016, it is shown that the majority of people would still choose to have a certain level of control behind their own vehicle rather than having the vehicle operate in Level 5 autonomy, or in other words, completely autonomous.|[145]| According to half of the respondents, the idea of safety in an autonomous vehicle diminishes as the level of autonomy increases.|[145]| This distrust of autonomous driving systems proved to be unchanged throughout the years when a nationwide survey conducted by |AAA Foundation for Traffic and Safety| (AAAFTS) in 2019 showed the same outcome as the survey KBB did in 2016. AAAFTS survey showed that even though people have a certain level of trust in automated vehicles, most people also have doubts and distrust towards the technology used in autonomous vehicles, with most distrust in Level 5 autonomous vehicles.|[146]| It is shown by AAAFTS’ survey that people\'s trust in autonomous driving systems increased when their level of understanding increased.|[146]|\n|\n|Malfunctions|[|edit|]|\n| |A prototype of an autonomous Uber car being tested in San Francisco|\n|\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The possibility of autonomous vehicle\'s technology to experience malfunctions is also one of the causes of user\'s distrust in autonomous driving systems.|[144]| In fact, it is the concern that most respondents voted for in the AAAFTS survey.|[146]| Even though autonomous vehicles are made to improve traffic safety by minimizing crashes and their severity,|[146]| they still caused fatalities. At least 113 autonomous vehicle related accidents have occurred until 2018.|[147]| In 2015, Google declared that their automated vehicles experienced at least 272 failures, and drivers had to intervene around 13 times to prevent fatalities.|[148]| Furthermore, other automated vehicles’ manufacturers also reported automated vehicles’ failures, including the Uber car incident.|[148]| The self-driving Uber car accident that happened in 2018 is one of the examples of autonomous vehicle accidents that are also listed in List of self-driving car fatalities.\xa0 One of the reports made by the |National Transportation Safety Board| (NTSB) showed that the self-driving Uber car was unable to identify the victim in a sufficient amount of time for the vehicle to slow down and avoid crashing into the victim.|[149]|\n|\n|Ethical|[|edit|]|\n|Another concern related to vehicle automation is its ethical issues. In reality, autonomous vehicles can encounter inevitable traffic accidents. In situations like that, many risks and calculations need to be made in order to minimize the amount of damage the accident could cause.|[150]| When a human driver encounters an inevitable accident, the driver will take a spontaneous action based on ethical and moral logic. However, when a driver has no control over the vehicle (Level 5 autonomy), the system of an autonomous vehicle is the one who needs to make that instant decision.|[150]| Unlike humans, autonomous vehicles don\'t have reflexes and it can only make decisions based on what it is programmed to do.|[150]| However, the situation and circumstances of accidents differ from one another, and one decision might not be the best decision for certain accidents. Based on two research studies in 2019,|[151]|[152]| the implementation of fully automated vehicles in traffic where semi-automated and non-automated vehicles are still present might lead to many complications.|[151]| Some flaws that still need consideration include the structure of liability, distribution of responsibilities,|[152]| efficiency in decision making, and the performance of autonomous vehicles with its diverse surroundings.|[151]| Still, researchers |Steven Umbrello| and |Roman V. Yampolskiy| propose that the |value sensitive design| approach is one method that can be used to design autonomous vehicles to avoid some of these ethical issues and design for human values.|[153]|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Self-driving car|\n|Self-driving truck|\n|Dashcam|\n|Intelligent speed adaptation|\n|Intelligent Transportation System|\n|PReVENT|\n|Robo-Taxi|\n|Transit media|\n|Uncrewed vehicle|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |"Self-steering Mars Rover tested at ESO\'s Paranal Observatory"|. |ESO Announcement|.

Compared to |internal combustion engine| (ICE) vehicles, electric cars are quieter, have no |exhaust emissions|, and lower |emissions| overall.|[1]| In the United States and the |European Union|, as of 2020, the total cost of ownership of recent electric vehicles is cheaper than that of equivalent ICE cars, due to lower fueling and maintenance costs.|[2]|[3]| Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of |charging stations|; these charging stations can be installed in both houses and public areas.|[4]|\n|Worldwide, 6.6\xa0million |plug-in electric cars| were sold in 2021, more than doubling 2020 sales, and achieving a market share of 9% of the global new car market.|[5]| All-electric cars represented 71% of plug-in car sales in 2021.|[6]| As of December\xa02021|[update]|, 16\xa0million plug-in electric cars were on the world\'s roads.|[5]| Many countries have established |government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles|, tax credits, subsidies, and other non-monetary incentives while several countries have legislated to |phase-out sales of fossil fuel cars|,|[7]|[8]| to reduce |air pollution| and |limit climate change|.|[9]|\n|The |Tesla Model 3| became the world\'s all-time best-selling electric car in early 2020,|[10]| and in June 2021 became the first electric car to pass 1\xa0million global sales.|[11]| Earlier models with widespread adoption include the Japanese |Mitsubishi i-MiEV| and the |Nissan Leaf|. Together with other emerging automotive technologies such as autonomous driving, connected vehicles and shared mobility, electric cars form a future mobility vision called Autonomous, Connected, Electric and Shared (ACES) Mobility.|[12]|\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Terminology|\n|2| |History|\n|\n|2.1| |Early developments|\n|2.2| |Modern electric cars|\n|\n|\n|3| |Economics|\n|\n|3.1| |Manufacturing cost|\n|3.2| |Total cost of ownership|\n|\n|3.2.1| |Purchase cost|\n|3.2.2| |Running costs|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|4| |Environmental aspects|\n|\n|4.1| |Public opinion|\n|\n|\n|5| |Performance|\n|\n|5.1| |Acceleration and drivetrain design|\n|\n|\n|6| |Energy efficiency|\n|\n|6.1| |Cabin heating and cooling|\n|\n|\n|7| |Safety|\n|\n|7.1| |Heaviness|\n|7.2| |Stability|\n|7.3| |Risk of fire|\n|\n|\n|8| |Controls|\n|9| |Batteries|\n|\n|9.1| |Range|\n|9.2| |Charging|\n|\n|9.2.1| |Connectors|\n|9.2.2| |Home charging|\n|9.2.3| |Public charging|\n|\n|9.2.3.1| |Electric roads|\n|\n|\n|9.2.4| |Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering|\n|\n|\n|9.3| |Lifespan|\n|\n|\n|10| |Currently available electric cars|\n|\n|10.1| |Highway capable|\n|10.2| |Electric cars by country|\n|\n|\n|11| |Government policies and incentives|\n|12| |EV plans from major manufacturers|\n|13| |Forecasts|\n|14| |See also|\n|15| |References|\n|16| |External links|\n|\n|\n|Terminology|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Vehicle classification by propulsion system|, |Plug-in electric vehicle §\xa0Terminology|, and |Battery electric vehicle|\n|The term "electric car" typically refers specifically to |battery electric vehicles| (BEVs) or all-electric cars, a type of |electric vehicle| (EV) that has an onboard |rechargeable battery pack| that can be plugged in and charged from the |electric grid|, and the electricity stored on the vehicle is the |only| energy source that provide propulsion for the wheels. The term generally refers to highway-capable automobiles, but there are also low-speed electric vehicles with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads. The latter are classified as |Neighborhood Electric Vehicles| (NEVs) in the |United States|,|[13]| and as electric |motorised quadricycles| in |Europe|.|[14]|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |History of the electric vehicle|\n|Early developments|[|edit|]|\n|Robert Anderson| is often credited with inventing the first electric car some time between 1832 and 1839.|[15]|\n|The following experimental electric cars appeared during the 1880s:\n|\n|In 1881, |Gustave Trouvé| presented an electric car at the |Exposition internationale d\'Électricité de Paris|.|[16]|\n|In 1884, over 20 years before the |Ford Model T|, |Thomas Parker| built an electric car in |Wolverhampton| using his own specially-designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries, although the only documentation is a photograph from 1895.|[17]|[18]|[19]|\n|In 1888, the German |Andreas Flocken| designed the |Flocken Elektrowagen|, regarded by some as the first "real" electric car.|[20]|[21]|[22]|\n|Electricity was among the preferred methods for automobile propulsion in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, providing a level of comfort and an ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline-driven cars of the time.|[23]| The electric vehicle fleet peaked at approximately 30,000 vehicles at the turn of the 20th century.|[24]|\n|In 1897, electric cars first found commercial use as |taxis| in Britain and in the United States. In London, |Walter Bersey|\'s |electric cabs| were the first self-propelled vehicles for hire at a time when cabs were horse-drawn.|[25]| In New York City, a fleet of twelve |hansom cabs| and one |brougham|, based on the design of the |Electrobat II|, formed part of a project funded in part by the |Electric Storage Battery Company| of |Philadelphia|.|[26]| During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the United States included Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, |Bailey Electric|, and |Detroit Electric|. Their electric vehicles were quieter than gasoline-powered ones, and did not require gear changes.|[27]|[28]|\n|Six electric cars held the |land speed record| in the 19th century.|[29]| The last of them was the rocket-shaped |La Jamais Contente|, driven by |Camille Jenatzy|, which broke the 100\xa0km/h (62\xa0mph) speed barrier by reaching a top speed of 105.88\xa0km/h (65.79\xa0mph) in 1899.\n|Electric cars remained popular until advances in |internal-combustion engine| (ICE) cars and |mass production| of cheaper gasoline- and |diesel|-powered vehicles led to a decline. ICE cars\' much quicker refueling times and cheaper production-costs made them more popular. However, a decisive moment came with the introduction in 1912 of the electric |starter motor|[30]| that replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as |hand-cranking|.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Gustave Trouvé|\'s personal electric vehicle (1881), the world\'s first publicly presented full-scale electric car\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Early electric car built by |Thomas Parker| - photo from 1895|[31]|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|"|La Jamais Contente|", 1899\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|NASA|\'s |Lunar Roving Vehicles| were battery-driven\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The |General Motors EV1|, one of the cars introduced due to a |California Air Resources Board| (CARB) mandate, had a range of 260\xa0km (160 miles) with |NiMH batteries| in 1999.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The |Tesla Roadster| helped inspire the modern generation of electric vehicles.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Modern electric cars|[|edit|]|\n|In the early 1990s the |California Air Resources Board| (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal of a move to |zero-emissions vehicles| such as electric vehicles.|[32]|[33]| In response, automakers developed electric models. These early cars were eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market, because of a massive campaign by the US automakers to discredit the idea of electric cars.|[34]|\n|California| electric-auto maker |Tesla Motors| began development in 2004 of what would become the |Tesla Roadster|, first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster was the first highway-legal all-electric car to use |lithium-ion battery| cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 320\xa0km (200 miles) per charge.|[35]|\n|Better Place|, a |venture-backed| company based in |Palo Alto, California|, but steered from |Israel|, developed and sold battery charging and |battery swapping| services for electric cars. The company was publicly launched on 29 October 2007 and announced deployment of |electric vehicle networks| in |Israel|, |Denmark| and |Hawaii| in 2008 and 2009. The company planned to deploy the infrastructure on a country-by-country basis. In January 2008, Better Place announced a |memorandum of understanding| with |Renault-Nissan| to build the world\'s first Electric Recharge Grid Operator (ERGO) model for Israel. Under the agreement, Better Place would build the electric recharge grid and |Renault-Nissan| would provide the |electric vehicles|. Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company\'s financial difficulties were caused by mismanagement, wasteful efforts to establish toeholds and run pilots in too many countries, the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, and a market penetration far lower than originally predicted.|[36]|\n|The |Mitsubishi i-MiEV|, launched in 2009 in Japan, was the first highway-legal |series production| electric car,|[37]| and also the first all-electric car to sell more than 10,000 units. Several months later, the |Nissan Leaf|, launched in 2010, surpassed the i MiEV as the best selling all-electric car at that time.|[38]|\n|Starting in 2008, a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries, and the desire to reduce |greenhouse-gas emissions| and to improve urban |air quality|.|[39]| During the 2010s, the |electric vehicle industry in China| expanded greatly with government support.|[40]| The subsidies introduced by the Chinese government will however be cut by 20 to 30% and phased out completely before 2023. Several automakers marked up the prices of their electric vehicles in anticipation of the subsidy adjustment, including Tesla, Volkswagen and Guangzhou-based GAC Group, which counts Fiat, Honda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, and Toyota as foreign partners.|[41]|\n|In July 2019 US-based |Motor Trend| magazine awarded the fully-electric Tesla Model S the title "ultimate car of the year".|[42]| In March 2020 the |Tesla Model 3| passed the Nissan Leaf to become the world\'s all-time best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered;|[10]| it reached the milestone of 1\xa0million global sales in June 2021.|[11]|\n|In the third quarter of 2021, the |Alliance for Automotive Innovation| reported that sales of electric vehicles had reached six percent of all US light-duty automotive sales, the highest volume of EV sales ever recorded at 187,000 vehicles. This was an 11% sales increase, as opposed to a 1.3% increase in gasoline and diesel-powered units. The report indicated that California was the US leader in EV with nearly 40% of US purchases, followed by Florida – 6%, Texas – 5% and New York 4.4%.|[43]|\n|Electric companies from the Middle East have been designing electric cars. Oman\'s |Mays Motors| have developed the |Mays i E1| which is expected to begin production in 2023. Built from carbon fibre, it has a range of about 560\xa0km (350 miles) and can accelerate from 0–130\xa0km/h (0–80\xa0mph) in about 4 secs.|[44]| In Turkey, the EV company |Togg| is starting production of its electric vehicles. Batteries will be created in a joint venture with the Chinese company |Farasis Energy|.|[45]|\n|\n|Economics|[|edit|]|\n|Manufacturing cost|[|edit|]|\n|The most expensive part of an electric car is its battery. The price decreased from €605 per kWh in 2010, to €170 in 2017, to €100 in 2019.|[46]|[47]| When designing an electric vehicle, manufacturers may find that for low production, converting existing |platforms| may be cheaper, as development cost is lower; however, for higher production, a dedicated platform may be preferred to optimize design, and cost.|[48]|\n|\n|Total cost of ownership|[|edit|]|\n|In the EU and US, but not yet China, the total cost of ownership of recent electric cars is cheaper than that of equivalent gasoline cars, due to lower fueling and maintenance costs.|[2]|[3]|[49]|\n|The greater the distance driven per year, the more likely the |total cost of ownership| for an electric car will be less than for an equivalent ICE car.|[50]| The break even distance varies by country depending on the taxes, subsidies, and different costs of energy.  In some countries the comparison may vary by city, as a type of car may have different charges to enter different cities; for example, in |England|, |London| charges ICE cars more than |Birmingham| does.|[51]|\n|\n|Purchase cost|[|edit|]|\n|Several national and local governments have established |EV incentives| to reduce the purchase price of electric cars and other plug-ins.|[52]|[53]|[54]|[55]|\n|As of 2020|[update]|, the |electric vehicle battery| is more than a quarter of the total cost of the car.|[56]| Purchase prices are expected to drop below those of new ICE cars when battery costs fall below |US$100| per kWh, which is forecast to be in the mid-2020s.|[57]|[58]|\n|Leasing or subscriptions are popular in some countries,|[59]|[60]| depending somewhat on national taxes and subsidies,|[61]| and end of lease cars are expanding the second hand market.|[62]|\n|In a June 2022 report by AlixPartners,  the cost for raw materials on an average EV rose from $3,381 in March 2020 to $8,255 in May 2022. The cost increase voice is attributed mainly to lithium, nickel, and cobalt.|[63]|\n|\n|Running costs|[|edit|]|\n|Electricity almost always costs less than gasoline per kilometer travelled, but the price of electricity often varies depending on where and what time of day the car is charged.|[64]|[65]| Cost savings are also affected by the price of gasoline which can vary by location.|[66]|\n|\n|Environmental aspects|[|edit|]|\n| |The |Salar de Uyuni| in |Bolivia| is one of the largest known |lithium| reserves in the world.|[67]|[68]|\n|Main article: |Environmental aspects of the electric car|\n|Electric cars have several benefits when replacing ICE cars, including a significant reduction of local air pollution, as they do not emit |exhaust pollutants| such as |volatile organic compounds|, |hydrocarbons|, |carbon monoxide|, |ozone|, |lead|, and various |oxides of nitrogen|.|[69]| Similar to ICE vehicles, electric cars emit particulates from tyre and brake wear|[70]| which may damage health,|[71]| although regenerative braking in electric cars means less brake dust.|[72]| More research is needed on non-exhaust particulates.|[73]| The sourcing of fossil fuels (oil well to gasoline tank) causes further damage as well as use of resources during the extraction and refinement processes.\n|Depending on the production process and the source of the electricity to charge the vehicle, emissions may be partly shifted from cities to the plants that generate electricity and produce the car as well as to the transportation of material.|[32]| The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the |emissions| of the electricity source and the efficiency of the vehicle. For |electricity from the grid|, the life-cycle emissions vary depending on the proportion of |coal-fired power|, but are always less than ICE cars.|[74]|\n|The cost of installing charging infrastructure has been estimated to be repaid by health cost savings in less than three years.|[75]| According to a 2020 study, balancing |lithium| supply and demand for the rest of the century will require good recycling systems, vehicle-to-grid integration, and lower lithium intensity of transportation.|[76]|\n|Some activists and journalists have raised concerns over the perceived lack of impact of electric cars in solving the climate change crisis|[77]| compared to other, less popularized methods.|[78]| These concerns have largely centered around the existence of less carbon-intensive and more efficient forms of transportation such as |active mobility|,|[79]| |mass transit| and e-scooters and the continuation of a system designed for cars first.|[80]|\n|\n|Public opinion|[|edit|]|\n|A 2022 survey found that 33% of car buyers in Europe will opt for a petrol or diesel car when purchasing a new vehicle. 67% of the respondents mentioned opting for the hybrid or electric version.|[81]|[82]| More specifically, it found that electric cars are only preferred by 28% of Europeans, making them the least preferred type of vehicle. 39% of Europeans tend to prefer |hybrid vehicles|, while 33% prefer petrol or |diesel vehicles|.|[83]|[84]|\n|44% Chinese car buyers, on the other hand, are the most likely to buy an electric car, while 38% of Americans would opt for a hybrid car, 33% would prefer petrol or diesel, while only 29% would go for an electric car.|[83]|[85]|\n|Specifically for the |EU|, 47% of car buyers over 65 years old are likely to purchase a hybrid vehicle, while 31% of younger respondents do not consider hybrid vehicles a good option. 35% would rather opt for a petrol or diesel vehicle, and 24% for an electric car instead of a hybrid.|[83]|[86]|\n|In the EU, only 13% of the total population do not plan on owning a vehicle at all.|[83]|\n|\n|Performance|[|edit|]|\n|Acceleration and drivetrain design|[|edit|]|\n| |Typical "skateboard" layout with the battery as floor and a motor at one or both axles|\n|Electric motors can provide high |power-to-weight ratios|. Batteries can be designed to supply the electrical current needed to support these motors. Electric motors have a flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, most electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.\n|Many electric cars have faster acceleration than average ICE cars, largely due to reduced drivetrain frictional losses and the more quickly-available torque of an electric motor.|[87]| However, NEVs may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors.\n|Electric vehicles can also use a |motor in each wheel hub| or next to the wheels, this is rare but claimed to be safer.|[88]| Electric vehicles that lack an |axle|, |differential|, or |transmission| can have less drivetrain inertia. Some |direct current motor|-equipped drag racer EVs have simple two-speed |manual transmissions| to improve top speed.|[89]| The concept electric supercar |Rimac Concept One| claims it can go from 0–97\xa0km/h (0–60\xa0mph) in 2.5 seconds. Tesla claims the upcoming |Tesla Roadster| will go 0–60\xa0mph (0–97\xa0km/h) in 1.9 seconds.|[90]|\n|\n|Energy efficiency|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Electric car energy efficiency|\n| |Energy efficiency of electric cars in towns and on motorways according to the |DoE|\n|Internal combustion engines have |thermodynamic limits| on efficiency, expressed as a fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. |Gasoline engines| effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories; |diesel engines| can reach on-board efficiency of 20%; electric vehicles have efficiencies of 69–72%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 59–62%, when counted against required energy to recharge.|[91]|[92]|\n|Electric motors are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. However, they are not equally efficient at all speeds. To allow for this, some cars with dual electric motors have one electric motor with a gear optimised for city speeds and the second electric motor with a gear optimised for highway speeds. The electronics select the motor that has the best efficiency for the current speed and acceleration.|[93]| |Regenerative braking|, which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.|[32]|[91]|\n|\n|Cabin heating and cooling|[|edit|]|\n|While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible |heat pump|, such as on the Nissan Leaf.|[94]| |PTC junction cooling|[95]| is also attractive for its simplicity—this kind of system is used, for example, in the 2008 Tesla Roadster.\n|To avoid using part of the battery\'s energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Renault Zoe and Tesla cars can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.|[96]|[97]|[98]|\n|Some electric cars (for example, the |Citroën Berlingo Electrique|) use an auxiliary heating system (for example |gasoline|-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with |solar power| |external batteries| and USB fans or coolers, or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked; two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.|[99]|\n|\n|Safety|[|edit|]|\n| |Side impact test of a |Tesla Model X|\n|The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard |ISO| 6469. This document is divided into three parts dealing with specific issues:\n|\n|On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery|[100]|\n|Functional safety means and protection against failures|[101]|\n|Protection of persons against electrical hazards|[102]|\n|Heaviness|[|edit|]|\n|The weight of the batteries themselves usually makes an EV heavier than a comparable gasoline vehicle. In a collision, the occupants of a heavy vehicle will, on average, suffer fewer and less serious injuries than the occupants of a lighter vehicle; therefore, the additional weight brings safety benefits (to the occupant).|[103]| On average, an accident will cause about 50% more injuries to the occupants of a 2,000\xa0lb (900\xa0kg) vehicle than those in a 3,000\xa0lb (1,400\xa0kg) vehicle.|[104]| Heavier cars are more dangerous to people outside the car if they hit a pedestrian or another vehicle.|[105]|\n|\n|Stability|[|edit|]|\n|The battery in |skateboard configuration| lowers the center of gravity, increasing driving stability, lowering the risk of an accident through loss of control.|[106]| If there is a separate motor near or in each wheel, this is claimed to be safer due to better handling.|[107]|\n|\n|Risk of fire|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents|\n|Like their ICE counterparts, |electric vehicle batteries| can catch fire after a crash or mechanical failure.|[108]| |Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents| have occurred, albeit fewer per distance traveled than ICE vehicles.|[109]| Some cars\' high-voltage systems are designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment,|[110]|[111]|  and in case of failure firefighters may be trained for manual high-voltage system shutdown.|[112]|[113]| Much more water may be required than for ICE car fires and a |thermal imaging camera| is recommended to warn of possible re-ignition of battery fires.|[114]|[115]|\n|\n|Controls|[|edit|]|\n|As of 2018|[update]|, most electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional |automatic transmission|. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear, and no |parking pawl| may be present, the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case, the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated |hand brake| provides the "P" mode.\n|In some cars, the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic transmission car.|[116]|\n|When an internal combustion vehicle\'s accelerator is released, it may slow by |engine braking|, depending on the type of transmission and mode. EVs are usually equipped with |regenerative braking| that slows the vehicle and recharges the battery somewhat.|[117]| Regenerative braking systems also decrease the use of the conventional brakes (similar to engine braking in an ICE vehicle), reducing brake wear and maintenance costs.\n|\n|Batteries|[|edit|]|\n| |Prototypes of 75 watt-hour/kilogram |lithium-ion polymer batteries|. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 280\xa0W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles.|\n|Main article: |Electric vehicle battery|\n|Lithium-ion-based batteries are often used for their high power and energy density.|[118]| Batteries with different chemical compositions are becoming more widely used, such as |lithium iron phosphate| which is not dependant on nickel and cobalt so can be used to make cheaper batteries and thus cheaper cars.|[119]|\n|\n|Range|[|edit|]|\n|Further information: |List of electric cars currently available|\n|The range of an electric car depends on the number and type of batteries used, and (as with all vehicles), the aerodynamics, weight and type of vehicle, performance requirements, and the weather.|[120]| Cars marketed for mainly city use are often manufactured with a short range battery to keep them small and light.|[121]|\n|Most electric cars are fitted with a display of the expected range. This may take into account how the vehicle is being used and what the battery is powering. However, since factors can vary over the route, the estimate can vary from the actual range. The display allows the driver to make informed choices about driving speed and whether to stop at a charging point en route. Some |roadside assistance| organizations offer charge trucks to recharge electric cars in case of emergency.|[122]|\n|Longest range in 2021 was 800\xa0km|[123]| and several companies aim to reach 1000\xa0km on a single charge in the mid-2020s.|[124]|[125]|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Comparison of |EPA|-rated |range| for |model year| 2020 electric cars rated up until January 2020|[126]|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|NIO ES8| has a swappable battery pack.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Charging|[|edit|]|\n| |BYD e6| is able to recharge to 80% in 15 minutes.|\n|Connectors|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |IEC 62196|\n|Most electric cars use |a wired connection| to supply electricity for recharging. Electric vehicle charging plugs are not universal throughout the world. However vehicles using one type of plug are generally able to charge at other types of charging stations through the use of plug adapters.|[127]|\n|The |Type 2 connector| is the most common type of plug, but different versions are used in China and Europe.|[128]|[129]|\n|The |Type 1 (also called SAE J1772)| connector is common in North America|[130]|[131]| but rare elsewhere, as it does not support |three-phase| charging.|[132]|\n|Wireless charging|, either for stationary cars or as an |electric road|,|[133]| is less common as of 2021|[update]|, but is used in some cities for taxis.|[134]|[135]|\n|\n|Home charging|[|edit|]|\n|Electric cars are usually charged overnight from a |home charging station|;  sometimes known as a charging point, wallbox charger, or simply a charger; in a garage or on the outside of a house.|[136]|[137]| As of 2021|[update]| typical home chargers are 7\xa0kW, but not all include |smart charging|.|[136]| Compared to fossil fuel vehicles, the need for charging using public infrastructure is diminished because of the opportunities for home charging; vehicles can be plugged in and begin each day with a full charge.|[138]| Charging from a standard outlet is also possible but very slow.\n|\n|Public charging|[|edit|]|\n| |Charging station at |Rio de Janeiro|, |Brazil|. This station is run by |Petrobras| and uses |solar energy|.|\n|Main article: |Electric vehicle charging network|\n|Public |charging stations| are almost always faster than home chargers,|[139]| with many |supplying direct current| to avoid the bottleneck of going through the car\'s AC to DC converter,|[140]| as of 2021|[update]| the fastest being 350\xa0kW.|[141]|\n|Combined Charging System| (CCS) is the most widespread charging standard,|[129]| whereas the |GB/T 27930| standard is used in China, and |CHAdeMO| in Japan. The United States has no de facto standard, with a mix of CCS, |Tesla Superchargers|, and CHAdeMO charging stations.\n|Charging an electric vehicle using public charging stations takes longer than refueling a fossil fuel vehicle. The speed at which a vehicle can recharge depends on the charging station\'s charging speed and the vehicle\'s own capacity to receive a charge.  As of 2021|[update]| some cars are 400 volt and some 800 volt.|[142]| Connecting a vehicle that can accommodate very fast charging to a charging station with a very high rate of charge can refill the vehicle\'s battery to 80% in 15 minutes.|[143]| Vehicles and charging stations with slower charging speeds may take as long as two hours to refill a battery to 80%. As with a mobile phone, the final 20% takes longer because the systems slow down to fill the battery safely and avoid damaging it.\n|Some companies are building |battery swapping| stations, to substantially reduce the effective time to recharge.|[144]|[145]| Some electric cars (for example, the |BMW i3|) have an optional gasoline |range extender|. The system is intended as an emergency backup to extend range to the next recharging location, and not for long-distance travel.|[146]|\n|\n|Electric roads|[|edit|]|\n|Electric road technologies which power and charge electric vehicles while driving were |assessed in Sweden| from 2013.|[147]|:\u200a12\u200a| The assessment was scheduled to conclude in 2022.|[148]| The first standard for electrical equipment on-board a vehicle powered by a rail electric road system (ERS), |CENELEC| Technical Standard 50717, has been approved in late 2022.|[149]| Following standards, encompassing "full interoperability" and a "unified and interoperable solution" for ground-level power supply, are scheduled to be published by the end 2024, detailing complete "specifications for communication and power supply through conductive rails embedded in the road".|[150]|[151]| The first permanent electric road in Sweden is planned to be completed by 2026|[152]| on a section of the |E20 route| between |Hallsberg| and |Örebro|, followed by an expansion of further 3000 kilometers of electric roads by 2045.|[153]| A working group of the |French Ministry of Ecology| considers |ground-level power supply| technologies the most likely candidate for electric roads,|[154]| and recommended adopting a European electric road standard formulated with Sweden, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, and others.|[155]| France plans to invest 30 to 40 billion euro by 2035 in an |electric road system| spanning 8,800 kilometers that recharges electric cars, buses and trucks while driving. Two tenders for assessment of electric road technologies are expected to be announced by 2023. |[154]|\n|\n|Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |vehicle-to-grid|\n|During |peak load| periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capabilities could contribute energy to the grid.

Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular |vehicles| used for road, water or air transport; the source of |energy|; and the |infrastructure| used to accommodate the transport (|roads|, |railways|, |airways|, |waterways|, |canals| and terminals). Transport operations and |logistics| as well as |transit-oriented development| are also involved in evaluation.|[1]| Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the |environmental| and |climate| impacts of the system.|[2]| Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of |world energy consumption| and |carbon dioxide emissions|.|[3]| The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels.|[4]| In 2019, about 95% of the fuel came from fossil sources. The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union is transportation. In 2019 it contributes to about 31% of global emissions and 24% of emissions in the EU. In addition, up to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions have only increased in this one sector.|[5]|[6]| Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector.|[7]| Road transport is also a major contributor to local |air pollution| and |smog|.|[8]|\n|Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve. Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections, and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased |mobility|,|[9]| with poor households benefiting  greatly from |low carbon| transport options.|[10]| The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental, social and economic costs that transport systems pose. Short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in |fuel efficiency| and |vehicle emissions controls| while long-term goals include migrating transportation from |fossil-based energy| to other alternatives such as |renewable energy| and use of other |renewable resources|. The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to |sustainability measurement| and optimization.|[11]|\n|The |United Nations Environment Programme| (UNEP) estimates that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided.|[12]| Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of |black carbon|, a component of |particulate matter|, which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change.|[13]| The links between |greenhouse gas emissions| and particulate matter make |low carbon| transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change; and by improving public health through better |air quality|.|[13]|\n|The social costs of transport include road crashes, air pollution, physical inactivity,|[14]| time taken away from the |family| while |commuting| and vulnerability to |fuel price increases|. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.|[15]| |Traffic congestion| imposes economic costs by wasting people\'s time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services. Traditional |transport planning| aims to improve mobility, especially for vehicles, and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts. But the real purpose of transport is access – to work, education, goods and services, friends and family – and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts, and managing traffic congestion.|[16]| Communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider program of creating more vibrant, livable, |sustainable cities|.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Definition|\n|2| |Benefits|\n|3| |Environmental impact|\n|4| |Transport and social sustainability|\n|5| |Potential shift to sustainable transport in developing countries|\n|6| |Cities|\n|7| |Policies and governance|\n|\n|7.1| |By country and city|\n|\n|7.1.1| |United Kingdom|\n|7.1.2| |Germany|\n|7.1.3| |United States|\n|7.1.4| |France|\n|\n|\n|7.2| |In the city level|\n|7.3| |Community and grassroots action|\n|7.4| |Sustainable development|\n|\n|\n|8| |Recent trends|\n|\n|8.1| |Greenwashing|\n|\n|\n|9| |Tools and incentives|\n|\n|9.1| |Possible measures for urban transport|\n|\n|\n|10| |History|\n|\n|10.1| |Mass motorization|\n|10.2| |Mobility transition|\n|\n|\n|11| |See also|\n|12| |References|\n|13| |Bibliography|\n|14| |External links|\n|\n|\n|\n|Definition|[|edit|]|\n| |Ekorent\'s electric car in |Helsinki|, |Finland|\n|The term |sustainable transport| came into use as a logical follow-on from |sustainable development|, and is used to describe modes of transport, and systems of transport planning, which are consistent with wider concerns of |sustainability|. There are many definitions of the sustainable transport, and of the related terms |sustainable transportation| and |sustainable mobility|.|[17]| One such definition, from the |European Union| Council of Ministers of Transport, defines a sustainable transportation system as one that:\n|\n|Allows the basic access and development needs of individuals, companies and society to be met safely and in a manner consistent with human and |ecosystem health|, and promotes equity within and between successive generations.|\n|Is affordable, operates fairly and efficiently, offers a choice of |transport mode|, and supports a |competitive economy|, as well as balanced regional development.|\n|Limits emissions and waste within the planet\'s ability to absorb them, uses |renewable resources| at or below their rates of generation, and uses non-renewable resources at or below the rates of development of renewable substitutes, while minimizing the impact on the |use of land| and the generation of |noise|.|\n|there is a need for people to do sustainable development\nSustainability extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions. A |life-cycle assessment| involves production, use and post-use considerations. A |cradle-to-cradle design| is more important than a focus on a single factor such as |energy efficiency|.|[18]|[19]|\n|\n|Benefits|[|edit|]|\n|Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of serious reports by the |Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)|, sustainable transport can help create jobs,|[20]| improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes, pedestrian pathways and non-pedestrian pathways,|[21]| make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people\'s time and household income as well as government budgets,|[22]| making investment in sustainable transport a \'win-win\' opportunity.\n|\n|Environmental impact|[|edit|]|\n|Main articles: |Green vehicle|, |electric bus|, and |light rail|\n| |The |bus rapid transit| of |Metz| uses a |diesel-electric hybrid| driving system, developed by Belgian |Van Hool| manufacturer.|[23]|\n| |Electric |Transmetro| in |Guatemala City|\n|Transport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases, responsible for 23% of world energy-related GHG emissions in 2004, with about three quarters coming from road vehicles. Data from 2011 stated that one-third of all greenhouse gases produced are due to transportation.|[24]| Currently 95% of transport energy comes from petroleum.|[7]| Energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles, and is |embodied| in transport infrastructure including roads, bridges and railways.|[25]| Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.|[26]|\n|The first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to |Theodore Von Karman|.|[27]| After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model, Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced a model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis.|[28]| Chester and Orwath,|[29]|[30]|[31]| have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure.\n|The |environmental impacts of transport| can be reduced by reducing the weight of vehicles,|[32]| sustainable styles of driving, reducing the friction of tires, encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles, improving the walking and |cycling environment| in cities, and by enhancing the role of |public transport|, especially |electric rail|.|[7]|\n|Green vehicles| are intended to have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when the environmental impact of a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its |life cycle| this may not be the case.|[33]|\n|Electric vehicle| technology has the potential to reduce transport CO|2| emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity.|[34]| In countries with a significant share of coal in their electricity production, adoptation of electric vehicles has only a small climate benefit or none at all. The climate benefits vary substantially and depend on the vehicle size, electricity emissions, driving patterns, and even the weather. As an example, a |Nissan Leaf| in the UK in 2019 produced one third of the greenhouse gases than the average internal combustion car.|[35]|\n|The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24\xa0km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100\xa0kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17\xa0cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface. At that power, only a few sections of the road need embedded cables.|[36]| |Hybrid vehicles|, which use an |internal combustion engine| combined with an |electric engine| to achieve better |fuel efficiency| than a regular combustion engine, are already common.\n|Natural gas| is also used as a transport fuel, but is a less promising technology as it is still a fossil fuel and still has significant emissions (though lower than gasoline, diesel, etc.).\n|Brazil met 17% of its transport fuel needs from |bioethanol| in 2007, but the |OECD| has warned that the success of (first-generation) biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances. Internationally, first-generation biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions, at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures.|[37]|\nThe later generation biofuels however (2nd to 4th generation) do have significant environmental benefit, as they are no driving force for deforestation or struggle with the |food vs fuel| issue. Other |renewable fuels| include hydrogen, which (like drop-in biofuels) |can be used in internal combustion vehicles|, don\'t rely on any crops at all (instead it\'s produced using electricity) and even generates very little pollution when burned.\n|In practice there is a sliding scale of |green transport| depending on the sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more |fuel-efficient|, but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronized |public transport| networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles.|[38]| Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and |electric buses| combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are |cycling| and other |human-powered vehicles|, and |animal powered transport|. The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is |walking|.\n|Transport on rails boasts an excellent efficiency (see |fuel efficiency in transportation|).\n|\n|Transport and social sustainability|[|edit|]|\n| |A tram in |Melbourne|, |Australia|\n|Cities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences, linked to radical drops in |public transport|, |walking|, and |cycling|. In many cases, streets became void of “life.” Stores, schools, government centers and libraries moved away from central cities, and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services. As schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic; the number of cars on US roads between 7:15 and 8:15\xa0a.m. increases 30% during the school year.|[39]|\n|Yet another impact was an increase in |sedentary lifestyles|, causing and complicating a national epidemic of |obesity|, and accompanying dramatically increased health care costs.|[14]|[40]|\n|Car-based transport systems| present barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods,|[41]| with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income.|[42]|\n|\n|\n|Potential shift to sustainable transport in developing countries|[|edit|]|\n|In developing countries such as Uganda, researchers have sought to determine factors that could possibly influence travelers to opt for bicycles as an alternative to motorcycle taxis (Bodaboda). The findings suggest that generally, the age, gender, and ability of the individual to cycle in the first place are key determinants of their willingness to shift to a more sustainable mode. Transport system improvements that could reduce the perceived risks of cycling were also seen to be the most impactful changes that could contribute towards the greater use of bicycles.|[43]|\n|\n|Cities|[|edit|]|\n| |Futurama|, an exhibit at the 1939 New York World\'s Fair, was sponsored by |General Motors| and showed a vision of the City of Tomorrow.|\n|Main article: |Transit-oriented development|\n|Further information: |Carfree city|\n|Cities are shaped by their transport systems. In |The City in History|, |Lewis Mumford| documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a walkable center, often located near a port or waterway, and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or, later, by rail or tram lines.\n|In 1939, the |New York World\'s Fair| included a model of an imagined city, built around a car-based transport system. In this "greater and better world of tomorrow", residential, commercial and industrial areas were separated, and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways. These ideas captured the popular imagination, and are credited with influencing city planning from the 1940s to the 1970s.|[44]|\n|\n| |Interstate 10| and |Interstate 45| near downtown |Houston|, |Texas|\n|The popularity of the car in the post-war era led to major changes in the structure and function of cities.|[45]| There was some opposition to these changes at the time. The writings of |Jane Jacobs|, in particular |The Death and Life of Great American Cities| provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation, and a record of community efforts to resist these changes. Lewis Mumford asked "is the city for cars or for people?"|[46]| |Donald Appleyard| documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in "The View from the Road" (1964) and in the UK, |Mayer Hillman| first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in 1971.|[47]| Despite these notes of caution, trends in car ownership,|[48]| car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post-war period.\n|Mainstream transport planning in Europe has, by contrast, never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility. For example, the |Dutch| Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met "if the contribution to societal welfare is positive", and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic.|[49]| Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to |land-use planning|, notably |Curitiba, Brazil|, |Portland, Oregon| and |Vancouver, Canada|.\n|\n| |Greenhouse gas emissions from transport vary widely, even for cities of comparable wealth. Source: |UITP|, Mobility in Cities Database.|\n|There are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for |private transport| than a Chinese urban resident, and almost four times as much as a European urban dweller. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of |walking|, |cycling|, and |public transport| use and to enduring features of the city including |urban density| and urban design.|[50]|\n|\n| |A bypass in the Old Town in |Szczecin|, Poland|\n|The cities and nations that have invested most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita |fossil fuel| use.|[50]| The social and economic sustainability of car-based |transportation engineering| has also been questioned. Within the United States, residents of |sprawling| cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighborhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often.|[51]| It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American.|[52]| A less car intensive means of urban transport is |carsharing|, which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to |The Economist|, carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles.|[53]| Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like |Zoom| in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries in an effort to reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand the number of people who have access to cars.|[54]|\n|The |European Commission| adopted the |Action Plan on urban mobility| on 30 September 2009 for sustainable urban mobility. The European Commission will conduct a review of the implementation of the Action Plan in the year 2012, and will assess the need for further action. In 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are key to growth and employment. Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants. Around 85% of the EU\'s |GDP| is generated in cities. Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental (|CO|2|, |air pollution|, |noise|) and competitiveness (|congestion|) terms while at the same time addressing social concerns. These range from the need to respond to |health| problems and |demographic| trends, fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of |persons with reduced mobility|, families and children.|[55]|\n|The |C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group| (C40) is a group of 94 cities around the world driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health and wellbeing of urban citizens. In October 2019, by signing the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration, 35 mayors recognized that breathing clean air is a human right and committed to work together to form a global coalition for clean air.|[56]|\n|\n|Policies and governance|[|edit|]|\n| |Seven sustainable transportations in one photo (|Prague|)|\n| |Carbon emissions per passenger|\n|By country and city|[|edit|]|\n|United Kingdom|[|edit|]|\n|In 2021 the |Institute for Public Policy Research| issued a statement saying that car use in the United Kingdom must shrink while |active transport| and |public transport| should be used more. The |Department for Transport| responded that they will spend 2 billion pounds on active transport, more than ever, including making England and the rest of the UK\'s railways greener.|[57]|\n|\n|Germany|[|edit|]|\n|Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.|[58]| An example is the modification in available transportation in |Freiburg, Germany|. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.|[24]|\n|\n|United States|[|edit|]|\n|Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.|[24]| Therefore, California, is one of the highest |greenhouse gases| emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:\n|\n|Improve public transport through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.|[59]|\n|Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.|\n|Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.|[60]|\n|Other states and nations have built efforts to |translate knowledge| in |behavioral economics| into |evidence-based| |sustainable transportation| policies.|[61]|\n|\n|France|[|edit|]|\n|In March 2022, an advertising regulation will come into force in France, requiring all advertising materials for automobiles to include one of three standard disclaimers promoting the use of sustainable transport practices. This applies to all vehicles, including electric vehicles. In 2028, it will also become illegal to advertise vehicles which emit more than 128 grams of carbon dioxide per-kilometre.|[62]|[63]|\n|\n|In the city level|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Urban sprawl|\n|Sustainable transport policies have their greatest impact at the city level.\n|Some of the biggest cities in Western Europe have a relatively sustainable transport. In |Paris| 53% of trips are made by walking, 3% by bicycle, 34% by public transport, and only 10% by car. In the entire |Ile-de-France| region, walking is the most popular way of transportation. In |Amsterdam|,  28% of trips are made by walking, 31%  by bicycle, 18% by public transport and only 23% by car.|[64]| In |Copenhagen| 62% of people commute to school or work by bicycle.|[65]|\n|Outside Western Europe, cities which have consistently included sustainability as a key consideration in transport and land use planning include |Curitiba, Brazil|; |Bogota, Colombia|; |Portland, Oregon|; and |Vancouver, Canada|. The |state of Victoria|, |Australia| passed legislation in 2010 – the |Transport Integration Act|[66]| – to compel its transport agencies to actively consider sustainability issues including climate change impacts in transport policy, planning and operations.|[67]|\n|Many other cities throughout the world have recognized the need to link sustainability and transport policies, for example by joining the |Cities for Climate Protection program|.|[68]|\n|\n|Oil price| trend, 1939–2007, both nominal and adjusted to inflation|Vehicle-miles traveled in the United States up to March 2009.|\n|Some cities are trying to become |car-free cities|, e.g., limit or exclude the usage of cars.|[69]|\n|In 2020, the |COVID-19 pandemic| pushed several cities to adopt a plan to drastically increase |biking| and |walking|; these included |Milan|, |London|, |Brighton|, and |Dublin|. These plans were taken to facilitate |social distancing| by avoiding public transport and at the same time prevent a rise in |traffic congestion| and air pollution from increase in car use.|[70]|[71]| A similar plan was adopted by |New York City|[72]| and |Paris|.|[73]| The pandemic\'s impact on urban public transportation means revenue declines will put a strain on operators\' finances and may cause creditworthiness to worsen. Governments might be forced to subsidize operators with financial transfers, in turn reducing resources available for investment in greener transportation systems.|[74]|[75]|[76]|\n|\n|Community and grassroots action|[|edit|]|\n|Sustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement, albeit one which is now recognized as of citywide, national and international significance.\n|Whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns, over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues, and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations, including the fast-growing population of older citizens. Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise, pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own, or cannot drive cars, and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden.|[77]|\n|An organization called |Greenxc| started in 2011 created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to |carpool| by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage, posts and photography.|[78]| Ride-sharing reduces individual\'s carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars.\n|At the beginning of the 21st century, some companies are trying to increase the use of |sailing ships|, even for commercial purposes, for example, Fairtrannsport and|[79]| New Dawn Traders|[80]| They have created the |Sail Cargo Alliance|.|[81]|\n|\n|Sustainable development|[|edit|]|\n|There are various |Sustainable Development Goals| (SDGs) that are promoting sustainable transport in order to meet the defined goals. These include |SDG 3| on health (increased road safety), |SDG 7| on energy, |SDG 8| on decent work and economic growth, |SDG 9| on resilient infrastructure, |SDG 11| on sustainable cities (access to transport and expanded public transport), |SDG 12| on sustainable consumption and production (ending |fossil fuel subsidies|) and SDG 14 on oceans, seas and marine resources.|[82]|\n|\n|Recent trends|[|edit|]|\n| |The global stock of electric vehicles grew steadily through the 2010s.|[83]|\n| |Overall GHG from transport|Car travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century, but trends since 2000 have been more complex. |Oil price rises from 2003| have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the US,|[84]| Britain and Australia. In 2008, global oil consumption fell by 0.8% overall, with significant declines in consumption in North America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia.|[85]|\n|Other factors affecting a decline in driving, at least in America, include the retirement of |Baby Boomers| who now drive less, preference for other travel modes (such as transit) by younger age cohorts, the |Great Recession|, and the rising use of technology (internet, mobile devices) which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive.|[86]|\n|\n|Greenwashing|[|edit|]|\n|The term |green transport| is often used as a |greenwash| marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a \n|\n| |Share of firms in the EU and the US taking action on climate by including sustainable transport options.|\n|positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance the |Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman| has targeted car manufacturers who claim that their cars are "green", "clean" or "|environmentally friendly|". Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words.|[87]| The |Australian Competition & Consumer Commission| (ACCC) describes "green" claims on products as "very vague, inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them".|[88]| In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its |green| marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court to be "misleading".|[89]|\n|\n|Tools and incentives|[|edit|]|\n| |Anthropogenic per capita emissions of greenhouse gases by country by the year 2000|Several European countries are opening up financial incentives that support more sustainable modes of transport. The |European Cyclists\' Federation|, which focuses on daily cycling for transport, has created a document containing a non-complete overview.|[90]| In the |UK|, employers have for many years been providing employees with financial incentives. The employee leases or borrows a bike that the employer has purchased. You can also get other support. The scheme is beneficial for the employee who saves money and gets an incentive to get exercise integrated in the daily routine. The employer can expect a tax deduction, lower sick leave and less pressure on parking spaces for cars.|[91]|[92]| Since 2010, there has been a scheme in |Iceland| (Samgöngugreiðslur) where those who do not drive a car to work, get paid a lump of money monthly. An employee must sign a statement not to use a car for work more often than one day a week, or 20% of the days for a period. Some employers pay fixed amounts based on trust. Other employers reimburse the expenses for repairs on bicycles, period-tickets for public transport and the like. Since 2013, amounts up to ISK 8000 per month have been tax-free. Most major workplaces offer this, and a significant proportion of employees use the scheme. Since 2019 half the amount is tax-free if the employee signs a contract not to use a car to work for more than 40% of the days of the contract period.|[93]|[94]|\n|Possible measures for urban transport|[|edit|]|\n|The |EU| |Directorate-General for Transport and Energy| (DG-TREN) has launched a program which focusses mostly on urban transport. Its main measures are:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Clean fuels and vehicles|\n|Animal-powered transport|\n|Biodiesel|\n|Biogas/|CNG|\n|Electric vehicles|\n|Human-powered transport|\n|Hybrid vehicles|\n|Hydrogen vehicle|\n|LPG|\n|Sailing ships|\n|Sustainable (green) transport infrastructure\n|Bikeways|\n|Busways|\n|Greenways| and |foreshoreways|\n|Railways|\n|Access restrictions\n|Access management / enforcement|\n|Car restricted zones / |living streets|\n|Multifunctional areas|\n|Parking| management|\n|Pedestrian zone|\n|Traffic calming| / speed reduction|\n|Integrated pricing strategies\n|Congestion pricing|\n|Integrated ticketing|\n|Parking management|\n|\n|\n|Collective passenger transport\n|Accessible transport systems|\n|Bus rapid transit|\n|Bus services|\n|Demand responsive transport|\n|Integrated ticketing|\n|Intermodal transfers|\n|Marketing|\n|Paratransit|\n|Park & Ride|\n|Public transport|\n|Quality of service|\n|Rail transport|\n|Security, including |transit police|\n|Travel information\n|Public transport route planners| (|intermodal| |journey planner|)|\n|Less car intensive lifestyle\n|Bike sharing|\n|List of bicycle-sharing systems|\n|Car pooling|\n|Car sharing|\n|Car/driver license exit strategies|\n|Cycling|\n|\n|\n|Soft measures\n|Travel blending|\n|Travel plan|\n|Personalised travel plan|\n|Walking school bus|\n|Transport management\n|New urbanism| and New pedestrianism|\n|TDM Toolbox|[95]|\n|Transit oriented development|\n|Transportation demand management|\n|Walkability|\n|Sustainable |freight| transport\n|Clean vehicles / clean fleet|\n|Dry port|\n|Fleet management|\n|Intermodal freight transport|\n|Route planning|\n|Transportation management system|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|Further information: |History of transport|\n|Most of the tools and concepts of sustainable transport were developed before the phrase was coined. |Walking|, the first mode of transport, is also the most sustainable.|[96]| |Public transport| dates back at least as far as the invention of the public bus by |Blaise Pascal| in 1662.|[97]| The first |passenger tram| began operation in 1807 and the |first passenger rail service| in 1825. |Pedal bicycles| date from the 1860s. These were the only personal transport choices available to most people in Western countries prior to |World War II|, and remain the only options for most people in the developing world. Freight was moved by human power, animal power or rail.\n|\n|Mass motorization|[|edit|]|\n|The post-war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods. The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979,|[48]| with similar trends in other Western nations. Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways, which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity. Transport planning became a branch of |Urban Planning| and identified |induced demand| as a pivotal change from "predict and provide" toward a sustainable approach incorporating |land use planning| and |public transit|. Public investment in transit, walking and |cycling| declined dramatically in the United States, Great Britain and Australia, although this did not occur to the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe.|[38]|[98]|\n|Concerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the |1973 oil crisis| and the |1979 energy crisis|. The high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel.\n|Transport innovations dating from this period include |high-occupancy vehicle lanes|, citywide |carpool| systems and |transportation demand management|. |Singapore| implemented |congestion pricing| in the late 1970s, and |Curitiba| began implementing its |Bus Rapid Transit| system in the early 1980s.\n|Relatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from 1980 to 2000, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as |urban sprawl|. Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for |just in time| deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic.\n|At the same time, the academic foundations of the "predict and provide" approach to transport were being questioned, notably by |Peter Newman| in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid-1980s.|[99]|\n|\nThe British Government\'s White Paper on Transport|[100]| marked a change in direction for transport planning in the UK. In the introduction to the White Paper, Prime Minister |Tony Blair| stated that|\n|We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face. It would be environmentally irresponsible – and would not work.\n|\n|\n|A companion document to the White Paper called "Smarter Choices" researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain, and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20%.|[101]|\n|A similar study by the United States Federal Highway Administration,|[102]| was also released in 2004 and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy.\n|\n|Mobility transition|[|edit|]|\n|This section is an excerpt from |Mobility transition|.|[|edit|]|\n| |Hermann Knoflacher| has been criticising |auto cities| and |car dependency| for decades. With his |walking gear|, he caricatures the enormous spatial demands of motorised private transport (2007)|\n|Mobility transition|[103]|[104]| is a set of social, technological and political processes of converting |traffic| (including |freight transport|) and |mobility| to sustainable transport with |renewable energy| resources, and an integration of several different modes of |private transport| and local |public transport|. It also includes |social change|, a redistribution of |public spaces|,|[105]| and different ways of financing and spending money in |urban planning|. The main motivation for mobility transition is the reduction of the harm and damage that traffic causes to people (mostly but not solely due to |collisions|) and the |environment| (which also often directly or indirectly affects people) in order to make (urban) society more livable, as well as solving various interconnected logistical, social, economic and energy issues and inefficiencies.|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|\n|Alternatives to car use|\n|Circular economy|\n|Cyclability|\n|Ecological modernization|\n|Electric bicycle|\n|Energy efficiency in transport|\n|Environmental impact of aviation|\n|Environmental impact of shipping|\n|Free public transport|\n|Freeway removal|\n|Green building|\n|Green infrastructure|\n|Green transport hierarchy|\n|Hypermobility|\n|Localism|\n|Modal share|\n|Michael Replogle|\n|Road reallocation|\n|Solar vehicle|\n|Sustainable architecture|\n|Sustainable aviation fuel|\n|Sustainable biofuel|\n|Sustainable distribution|\n|Urban vitality|\n|Wind-powered vehicle|\n|\n|Groups:|\n|\n|EcoMobility Alliance|\n|Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|\n|International Association of Public Transport|\n|Michelin Challenge Bibendum|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |"Sustainable city"|. |HiSoUR - Hi So You Are|. 2018-10-04|.

OnStar was created by GM working with |Motorola| Automotive (that was later bought by Continental). The primary purpose was safety and to get emergency help to a vehicle when there was an accident. The sooner medical helps arrives the more likely the drivers and passengers would survive. A cellular telephone call would be routed to a |call center| where the agent sent help.|[5]|\n|At first, OnStar only worked with voice but when cellular systems added data the system was able to send the |GPS| location to the call center. After the success of OnStar, many automakers followed with similar safety programs that usually come with a free trial for a new car and then a paid subscription after the trial is over.\n|Remote diagnostics| were introduced in 2001. By 2003 connected car services included vehicle health reports, |turn-by-turn directions| and a network access device. Data-only |telematics| were first offered in 2007.\n|In the summer of 2014, Audi was the first automaker to offer 4G |LTE| Wi-Fi |Hotspots| access and the first mass deployment of 4G LTE was by General Motors.\n|By 2015, OnStar had processed 1 billion requests from customers.|[6]|\n|AA plc| (formerly known as The Automobile Association) introduced Car Genie, the first piece of connected car technology in the UK that connects directly to a breakdown service, not only warning of issues with car health, but intervening directly with a phone call to customers to help them prevent a breakdown.|[7]|\n|In 2017, European technology start-up |Stratio Automotive| provides over 10,000 vehicles |predictive intelligence| enabling fleet operators to better manage and maintain their vehicles.|[8]|\n|\n|Types of connectivity|[|edit|]|\n|There are 5 ways a vehicle can be connected to its surroundings and communicate with them:|[9]|\n|\n|V2I "|Vehicle to Infrastructure|": The technology captures data generated by the vehicle and provides information about the infrastructure to the driver. The V2I technology communicates information about safety, mobility or environment-related conditions.|[10]|\n|V2V "|Vehicle to Vehicle|": The technology communicates information about speed and position of surrounding vehicles through a wireless exchange of information. The goal is to avoid accidents, ease traffic congestions and have a positive impact on the environment.|[11]|\n|V2C "|Vehicle to Cloud|": The technology exchanges information about and for applications of the vehicle with a |cloud| system. This allows the vehicle to use information from other, though the cloud connected industries like energy, transportation and smart homes and make use of |IoT|.|[12]|\n|V2P "|Vehicle to Pedestrian|":  The technology senses information about its environment and communicates it to other vehicles, infrastructure and personal mobile devices. This enables the vehicle to communicate with pedestrians and is intended to improve safety and mobility on the road.|[13]|\n|V2X "|Vehicle to Everything|": The technology interconnects all types of vehicles and infrastructure systems with another. This connectivity includes cars, highways, ships, trains and airplanes.|[14]|\n|Categories of applications|[|edit|]|\n|Applications can be separated into two categories:\n|\n|Single vehicle applications: In-car content and service applications implemented by a single vehicle in connection with a cloud or backoffice.|\n|Cooperative safety and efficiency applications: they provide connectivity between vehicles (or infrastructure) directly have to work cross-brand and cross-borders and require standards and regulation. Some may be convenience applications, others safety, which may require regulation.|\n|Examples include, amongst others: \n|\n|Single-vehicle applications: concierge features provided by automakers or apps alert the driver of the time to leave to arrive on time from a calendar and send text message alerts to friends or business associates to alert them of arrival times such as BMW Connected NA that also helps find parking or |gas stations|.|[15]| The European |eCall| would be an example of a single vehicle safety application that is mandatory in the |EU|.|[16]|\n|Cooperative safety-of-life and cooperative efficiency: |forward collision warning|, |lane change warning/blind spot warning|, emergency brake light warning, intersection movement assist, emergency vehicle approaching, road works warning, automatic notification of crashes, notification of speeding and safety alerts.|[17]|[18]|\n|The connected car segment can be further classified into eight categories.|[19]|\n|\n|Mobility management|: functions that allow the driver to reach a destination quickly, safely, and in a cost-efficient manner (e.g.: Current traffic information, Parking lot or garage assistance, Optimised fuel consumption)|\n|Commerce|: functions enabling users to purchase good or services while on-the-go (e.g., fuel, food & beverage, parking, tolls)|\n|Vehicle management: functions that aid the driver in reducing operating costs and improving ease of use (e.g., vehicle condition and service reminders, remote operation, transfer of usage data)|\n|Breakdown prevention: connected to a breakdown service, with a back end algorithm predicting breakdowns and an outbound service intervening via phone, SMS or push notification|\n|Safety: functions that warn the driver of external hazards and internal responses of the vehicle to hazards  (e.g., emergency breaking, lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, blind spot object identification)|\n|Entertainment: functions involving the entertainment of the driver and passengers (e.g., smartphone interface, WLAN hotspot, music, video, Internet, social media, mobile office)|\n|Driver assistance: functions involving partially or fully automatic driving (e.g., operational assistance or autopilot in heavy traffic, in parking, or on highways)|\n|Well-being: functions involving the driver\'s comfort and ability and fitness to drive (e.g., fatigue detection, automatic environment adjustments to keep drivers alert, medical assistance)|\n|Single-vehicle applications|[|edit|]|\n|Current automobiles entail embedded |navigation systems|, smartphone integration and multimedia packages.|[20]| Typically, a connected car made after 2010 has a head-unit, |in car entertainment| unit, in-dash system with a screen from which the operations of the connections can be seen or managed by the driver. Types of functions that can be made include music/audio playing, smartphone apps, navigation, roadside assistance, voice commands, contextual help/offers, parking apps, engine controls and car diagnosis.|[5]|\n|On January 6, 2014, Google announced the formation of the |Open Automotive Alliance| (OAA) a global alliance of technology and auto industry leaders committed to bringing the Android platform to cars starting in 2014. The OAA includes Audi, GM, Google, Honda, Hyundai and Nvidia.|[21]|\n|On March 3, 2014, Apple announced a new system to connect iPhone 5/5c/5S to car infotainment units using iOS 7 to cars via a Lightning connector, called |CarPlay|.\n|Android Auto| was announced on June 25, 2014 to provide a way for Android smartphones to connect to car infotainment systems.\n|Increasingly, connected cars (and especially electric cars) are taking advantage of the rise of smartphones, and apps are available to interact with the car from any distance. Users can unlock their cars, check the status of batteries on electric cars, find the location of the car, or remotely activate the climate control system.\n|Innovations to be introduced until 2020 include the full integration of smartphone applications, such as the linkage of the smartphone calendar, displaying it on the car\'s windshield and automatic address searches in the navigation system for calendar entries.|[20]| In the longer term, navigation systems will be integrated in the windshield and through augmented reality project digital information, like alerts and traffic information, onto real images from the driver\'s perspective.|[20]|\n|Near-term innovations regarding Vehicle Relationship Management (VRM) entail advanced remote services, such as GPS tracking and personalized usage restrictions. Further, maintenance services like |over-the-air| tune-ups, requiring the collaboration of car dealers, OEMs and service centers, are under development.|[20]|\n|Despite various market drivers there are also barriers that have prevented the ultimate breakthrough of the connected car in the past few years. One of these is the fact that customers are reluctant to pay the extra costs associated with embedded connectivity and instead use their smartphones as solution for their in-car connectivity needs. Because this barrier is likely to continue, at least in the short-term, car manufacturers are turning to smartphone integration in an effort to satisfy consumer demand for connectivity.|[22]|\n|\n|Cooperative safety-of-life and efficiency|[|edit|]|\n|These services relate to |Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)|, that depend on the sensory input of more than one vehicle and enable instant reaction through automatic monitoring, alerting, braking and steering activities.|[23]| They depend on instant vehicle-to-vehicle communication, as well as infrastructure, functioning across brands and national borders and offering cross-brand and cross-border levels of privacy and security. The |US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)| for that reason has argued for regulation in its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on V2V Communication|[24]| and argued the case in US Congress.|[25]| NHTSA began the rule-making process on December 13, 2016, proposing to mandate dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology in new light vehicles.|[26]| Under this proposed rule, vehicles would broadcast a defined data packet, the "basic safety message" (BSM) up to ten times per second, indicating vehicle location, heading, and speed. In March, 2017, GM became the first US automaker to provide DSRC as standard equipment on a production automobile, the Cadillac CTS.|[27]| The US also has appropriate standards – |IEEE 802.11p| – and frequency rules|[28]| in place. In Europe a frequency is harmonised for transport safety|[29]| and a harmonised standard, called ETSI ITS-G5,|[30]| are in place. In the EU there is no push to oblige vehicle manufacturers to introduce connect. Discussions about a regulatory framework for privacy and security are ongoing.|[31]|\n|Technologically speaking cooperative applications can be implemented.|[32]| Here the regulatory framework is the main obstacle to implementation, questions like privacy and security need to be addressed. British weekly "The Economist" even argues that the matter is regulatory driven.|[33]|\n|\n|Hardware|[|edit|]|\n|The necessary hardware can be divided into built-in or brought-in connection systems. The built-in telematics boxes most commonly have a proprietary Internet connection via a |GSM| module and are integrated in the car IT system. Although most connected cars in the United States use the GSM operator |AT&T| with a GSM SIM such as the case with Volvo,|[34]| some cars such as the Hyundai Blue Link system utilizes |Verizon Wireless Enterprise|, a non-GSM CDMA operator.|[35]|\n|Most brought-in devices are plugged in the OBD (|on-board diagnostics|) port for electrification and access to vehicle data and can further be divided into two types of connection:\n|\n|Hardware relies on customers smartphone for the Internet connection or|\n|Hardware establishes proprietary internet connection via GSM module.|\n|All forms of hardware have typical use cases as drivers. The built-in solutions were mostly driven by safety regulations in Europe for an automated Emergency Call (abbr. |eCall|). The brought-in devices usually focus on one customer segment and one specific use case.|[36]|\n|\n|Insurance|[|edit|]|\n|The data provided by greater vehicle connectivity is impacting the car insurance industry.|[20]| Predictive-modeling and machine-learning technologies, as well as real-time data streaming, providing among others information on driving speed, routes and time, are changing insurers\' doing-of-business.|[20]|[37]| Early adopters have begun to adjust their offering to the developments in the automotive industry, leading them to transition from being pure insurance product provider to becoming insurance-service hybrids.|[37]|\n|Progressive, for example, has introduced its usage-based-insurance program, Snapshot, in 2008, which takes into account driving times and ability. The data gathered through an |onboard diagnostics device| allows the company to perform further personal and regional risk assessments.|[37]| \nAnother innovation being tested in the insurance industry regards |telematics| devices, which transmit vehicle and driver data through |wide-area networks| and are subsequently used to influence driving behavior, for legal purposes and the identification of fraudulent insurance claims. Further applications are dynamic risk profiles and improved customer segmentation.|[37]|\nFuture services include coaching on driving skills for fuel efficiency and safety reasons, the prediction of maintenance needs and providing advise to car owners regarding the best time to sell their car.|[37]|\n|\n|Trends|[|edit|]|\n|The following trends are strengthening the shift towards a fully developed connected cars industry, changing the concept of what is understood as a car and what are its functions.\n|Technological innovation in the field of connectivity is accelerating.|[38]| High-speed computers help make the car aware of its surroundings, which can transform manoeuvring a self-driving vehicle an increasing reality.|[39]|\n|There are initiatives to use |ethernet| technology to connect the sensors that allow for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Through the ethernet, network speed inside the vehicle can increase from one |megabit| to |gigabits|.|[40]| Further, ethernet uses switches that allow connections to any number of devices, reducing the amount of cabling required and thus the overall weight of the car. Moreover, it is more scalable, allowing devices and sensors to connect at different speeds and has the benefit of components being available off the shelf.|[41]|\n|In fact, research also shows that customers are willing to switch manufacturers just to be able to use mobile devices and connectivity. In 2014 there were 21% who were willing to do so whereas in 2015 this number climbed up to 37%. On top of that 32% of those customers would also be ready to pay for a service related to connectivity on top on a base model. This figure has been at 21% in 2014, one year before. The increase of customers willing to switch manufacturers and to pay for such services shows the increase in importance for connected cars.|[42]|\n|The |Internet of Things| will be used to provide mobile services in the car with high-speed Internet. This feature will enable real time traffic control, interaction with the car manufacturer service for remote diagnostics and improved company logistics automation. Moreover, in the beginning of the self-driven car era, internet will be used for information exchange between the cars for better route selection and accident reports.|[43]|\n|\n|Criticism|[|edit|]|\n|Drawbacks and Challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Although the connected car offers both benefits and excitement to the drivers, it also faces drawbacks and challenges;\n|\n|A major issue with the connected cars is hackability. The more it is connected to the Internet and to the system, it becomes more exposed to being penetrated from the outside. If the service and help can be provided from distance by |car-makers|, through that channel, |hackers| can access and control the car as well. In |Germany| and |Brazil|, 59% of car drivers are afraid to be hacked into their car if it is connected to the Internet. In the |U.S| there are 43% and in |China| 53% whereas the average lies at 54%.|[44]|\n|Reliability| is also a major concern. Cars, |sensor|, and network hardware will malfunction. The system has to deal with incorrect data, as well as faulty communications, such as denial of service attacks.|\n|Privacy is another dimension, both with hacking and with other uses. Sensitive data gathered from the car such as the location, driver\'s daily route, apps that are used, etc. are all susceptible to be hacked and used for unauthorised purposes,|[45]| as well as being used by businesses and government. In Germany for example 51% of car drivers do not want to use car-related connected services because they want to keep their privacy. In the U.S it is 45%, in Brazil 37% and in China 21% of the car drivers that think so. The average lies at 37%.|[44]|\n|A simple failure in the system, whether in the connected car, or elsewhere in the network, while on the |autonomous drive| can cause fatal consequences.|\n|Fighting the challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Changing the |design| of products: the way that the product is developed and the "maintenance-respond-architecture" play a crucial role. Companies have to focus on long term solutions in terms of design security because quick changes are costly and easy to circumvent. Integrating this sphere at the earliest stage possible when developing the product can be the right approach for the companies.|\n|Internal cooperation between departments of the company: product-security teams and corporate IT-security teams will have to work closely together in order to prevent the hackability of their devices. To do so, companies may create guidelines that minimize probabilities of bugs, and security gaps (software). Making modifying and patching systems easier can be another effect driven from that.|\n|Over-the-air updates: As short term solutions are also easy to solve problems a technology called OTA (over-the-air) becomes more and more important to OEMs. These OTA updates allow companies to quickly detect problems/attacks and prevent the malefactors to become active and attack the system. However, this is a very costly approach and companies have to know the architecture of their systems in detail to directly attack the issue not to lose money on inefficiency.|\n|Value chain| security: As companies are the final integrators of security systems they also have to control security all along the value chain. Also suppliers have to make sure that security plays the most important role for the mobile device. Taking the example of the procurement department, it has to make sure that the cybersecurity features of the final product are negotiated and available. The whole security issue starts at the beginning of the value chain. This approach can be used to actually define and shape future security standards in the industry and make sure that every player in the industry has the same understanding of the importance of security.|[46]|\n|Connected Car Service Features|[|edit|]|\n|Mobile App Service|\n|\n|\n|Manufacturer\n|\n|Service\n|\n|Mobile App\n|\n|Features (Compatible based on model)\n|\n|Safety

{'CLASS': 'SHARED', 'DOMAIN': 'en.wikipedia.org', 'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_subscription', 'URL_TEXT': '\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Vehicle subscription|\n|\n|From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia|\n|\n|\n|\n|Jump to navigation|\n|Jump to search|\n|\n|\n|Not to be confused with |Carsharing|.|\n|\n|Vehicle subscription| is a |service| where a customer pays a recurring |fee| for the right to use one or more |automotive vehicles|. Some vehicle subscriptions offer |insurance| and |maintenance| as part of the subscription fee; other subscriptions allow the |subscriber| to switch between different vehicles during their subscription period. Industry commentators consider vehicle subscription to be an alternative to |owning| or |leasing| a vehicle.|[1]|[2]|\n|Vehicle subscriptions have been available since 2010 when Rima Braden of Autosource, LLC offered a short-term flexible auto acquisition program from his dealership in Honolulu, Hawaii that he coined "Flexlease".  Rebranded as "Carousel" in 2013, the program was restricted to the city and county of Honolulu and remains in operation today.  In 2014 flexdrive, now jointly owned by |Cox Automotive| and Holman Enterprises, launched.|[3]| Clutch Technologies, a start-up, launched a subscription service for consumers in |Atlanta| in mid-2014; Flow Automotive Companies was the first |automotive| |dealership| to offer a subscription service, launching Drive Flow in |Winston-Salem| in 2016, using Clutch\'s technology platform.|[4]| 2017 saw several automotive |manufacturers| announce and launch subscription services, including Book by Cadillac, Porsche Passport, Care by Volvo and |Canvas| (backed by |Ford Motor Company|).|[5]| By 2018, a number of startups and automotive |dealership| companies had launched subscriptions in multiple markets |[6]| and flexdrive became the first U.S.-based car subscription company to support dealerships and fleet operators stateside and globally through its partnership with Dribe in Denmark.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Definition|\n|2| |Common features|\n|3| |Types of providers and business models|\n|\n|3.1| |Automotive manufacturers|\n|3.2| |Automotive dealerships|\n|3.3| |Start-ups and corporate-backed ventures|\n|3.4| |Car subscription software providers|\n|3.5| |Other providers|\n|\n|\n|4| |References|\n|\n|\n|Definition|\n|Vehicle subscriptions are a type of |subscription business model| where a customer pays a periodic fee for the use of one or more vehicles. The difference between a vehicle subscription and buying a vehicle is that the subscription service retains ownership of the vehicle. While vehicle subscriptions and traditional automotive |leases| both involve recurring payments, many subscription services offer more flexibility in terms of minimum term and the ability to swap between vehicles.|[1]| The main difference between vehicle subscriptions and |vehicle or car rental| is that most subscriptions are designed to offer full-time possession of a vehicle such that the subscription replaces the customer\'s primary vehicle, whereas rental involves the effort of procuring vehicles for specific dates or trips.|[7]|\n|Vehicle subscriptions have been variously been identified as part of the "|sharing economy|" or part of the "subscription economy".|[8]|[9]| Vehicle subscriptions have also been classified as a form of "|transportation-as-a-service"| and as a form of "mobility-as-a-service".|[10]|[11]|\n|\n|Common features|\n|Edmunds.com observes that there is a wide variety in the types of vehicle subscriptions that are available, such that many different customer needs can be met across the various services. Most vehicle subscriptions allow customers to pay a flat periodic fee, typically on a monthly basis. Whereas some subscription offerings have no minimum term (e.g., Book by Cadillac), others do have a minimum term (e.g., Care by Volvo launched with a two-year minimum term). Vehicle subscriptions include flat-rate, no-haggle pricing. Prospective customers typically sign-up using an app. The monthly fee may include insurance, maintenance and roadside assistance. Some services include a mileage limit and some offer unlimited mileage. Several services, such as Carousel, Porsche Passport and Book by Cadillac, offer the option to swap between different types of vehicles. Some services offer unlimited swaps and some restrict the number of swaps.|[1]|[2]|[12]|[5]|\n|\n|Types of providers and business models|\n|Vehicle subscriptions are offered by several different categories of company. Each category is pursuing a slightly different business model.\n|\n|Automotive manufacturers|\n|Several automotive manufacturers and brands offer or have announced vehicle subscriptions, including |Porsche|, |Volvo|, |Cadillac|, |Hyundai|, |Mercedes Benz|, |BMW|,  |Lexus| and Ford. These services offer subscribers vehicles from a single brand or, in the case of Volvo, a single vehicle. While initial launches have tended to focus on one or two cities,|[13]|[14]| there is evidence that the manufacturers will eventually offer their services more broadly: for example Care by Volvo was immediately available across the country and Book by Cadillac has expanded beyond its original launch market of New York City.|[15]|[16]|\n|The manufacturers have announced various objectives for these programs. Volvo has described the objective of Care by Volvo as to provide convenience by offering access, insurance, maintenance and support within a single package.|[17]| Cadillac has described the objective of Book by Cadillac as being to grow the number of Cadillac drivers, particularly those who are new to the brand.|[18]| Porsche has described their Passport service as a way to cater to customers with highly varied lives.|[10]| Ford has described Canvas as a way to grow the number of Ford drivers while also controlling the number of used vehicles hitting automotive auctions.|[11]|\n|In April 2018 the |BMW Group| started their own vehicle subscription service Access by BMW as a trial in Nashville, Tennessee. Access is currently available in USA and Singapore.\n|In May 2020 the BMW Group started their own vehicle subscription service in MINI Subscribe. MINI Subscribe is currently available in major German cities such as Munich and Hamburg, offering a range of models including the iconic MINI Cooper, MINI Cooper SE and the MINI Cooper Countryman.\n|\n|Automotive dealerships|\n|A number of automotive dealerships have launched vehicle subscriptions focused on the markets where they have stores. The services offered by these dealerships typically include vehicles from several different brands offered by their stores, allowing customers to drive a wide variety of vehicles. Examples:\n|\n|The Jeff Wyler Automotive Group offers a subscription service, Wyler Fastlane, in their home market of Cincinnati.|\n|Flow Automotive|\n|Park Place Select in Dallas|[19]|\n|Inride, in the Washington DC/Baltimore area|\n|Carousel, based in Honolulu, Hawaii|\n|Portfolio by OpenRoad, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, launched in November 2018|\n|Start-ups and corporate-backed ventures|\n|This section |contains content that is written like |an advertisement|.| Please help |improve it| by removing |promotional content| and inappropriate |external links|, and by adding encyclopedic content written from a |neutral point of view|.| |(|June 2020|)| (|Learn how and when to remove this template message|)|\n|A large number of |start-ups| have been created to offer vehicle subscription services. One early pioneer in the vehicle subscription space was Joule.|[20]| Other USA-based start-ups include Go,|[21]| Carma, Borrow,|[22]|  and Mobiliti.|[23]| Several vehicle subscription start-ups have been founded in Europe, including Wagonex, Cocoon Vehicles and |Drover|, from the United Kingdom, and Dribe and Bilabonnement, both from |Denmark|.|[24]|[25]|[26]| A UK based startup, Elmo, focuses on a subscription service exclusively for electric vehicles.|[27]| In 2017, |Gurgaon| based startup |Revv Cars|, launched monthly multi-brand car subscription program Switch across 15 cities in |India|.|[28]|\n|In 2018, another Indian company was launched. |Myles| Automotive Technologies (Delhi-based) is a multi-brand car subscription brand operating in all metropolitan cities.\n|Several established companies have created new |business units| that are offering vehicle subscriptions. In the US, |Cox Enterprises| launched flexdrive.|[29]| In Europe, |LeasePlan|, a vehicle leasing company, will offer subscriptions with their CarNext.com platform.|[30]|[31]|\n|VAI, a brazilian subscription service for ride-sharing drivers was founded in December 2017 in Sao Paulo.\n|The German company like2drive GmbH was founded in February 2018 as part of the Fleetpool Group.|[32]|\n|Cluno, a multi-brand car subscription service operating in Germany, was founded in October 2017.|[33]|\n|A car subscription service in Czech Republic, called Driveto Klub, was launched in October 2018 by Driveto.|[34]| Driveto was founded in Prague in 2017 and started as an online aggregator of |operating lease| offers. The majority of the start-up is owned by |Miton|, an online investment group from |Jablonec nad Nisou|.\n|Australia\'s car subscription services|[35]| include Carbar, HelloCars and Carly, all of which were launched in early 2019. As registered Victorian and NSW motor dealers, Carbar and HelloCars subscription vehicles are owned and operated by their respective companies while Carly utilises peer-to-peer customer vehicles offered in partnership with sister company DriveMyCar Rentals Pty Ltd. In addition to retail car subscription providers, the Australian market has also seen the launch of Loopit, a software platform enabling OEMs, dealerships and rental car companies to launch and manage their own car subscription product.\n|A pioneer in the Swiss vehicle subscription market is Carvolution AG, launched in 2018,|[36]| supported a 50 million CHF investment by the insurance group |Die Mobiliar Versicherungsgesellschaft AG|[37]| In partnerships with |Mobilezone Holding AG|[38]| and |LIDL|,|[39]| the start-up holds around 80% of the market share.|[40]|[41]|\n|CARIFY, with the largest selection of cars of similar ventures in Switzerland, was founded in September 2019 by Sergio Studer and Raffael Fiechter.|[42]|\n|Vehicle subscription has also begun to flourish in the Middle East, with Invygo launching the region\'s first car subscription app in March 2019.|[43]|\n|\n|Car subscription software providers|\n|Loopit (formerly Blinker Subscription) was launched in Australia in August 2019 and provides car subscription software to automotive manufacturers, car dealerships, car subscription companies and other related businesses to operate their own vehicle subscription service. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Loopit experienced a 52% increase in enquiries from car dealerships looking to introduce a car subscription model during the shutdown.|[44]|\n|\n|Other providers|\n|Zipcar| is offering a version of vehicle subscription, dubbed Zipcar Commuter, that provides dedicated possession of a vehicle from Monday to Friday.|[45]|\n|\n|References|\n|\n|\n|^ |a| |b| |c| |"What Are Car Subscription Services? | Edmunds"|. |Edmunds|. 10 January 2018|.

It differs from traditional car rental in that the owners of the cars are often private individuals themselves, and the carsharing facilitator is generally distinct from the car owner. Carsharing is part of a larger trend of |shared mobility|.\n|Carsharing enables an occasional use of a vehicle or access to different brands of vehicles. The renting organization may be a commercial business. Users can also organize as a |company|, public agency, |cooperative|, or |ad hoc| grouping. The network of cars on the network becomes available to the users through a variety of means, ranging from the simplicity of using an app to unlock the car in real time, to meeting the owner of the car in order to exchange keys. As of January 2020 the world\'s top city for car sharing is |Moscow with more than 30,000 vehicles|[1]| (though in Moscow almost all carsharing cars are owned by large facilitators).\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |History|\n|\n|1.1| |Early days|\n|1.2| |Boom in the United States|\n|1.3| |Development and growth|\n|1.4| |Global development and comparison in urban regions|\n|\n|\n|2| |Types of carsharing|\n|\n|2.1| |Round-trip carsharing|\n|2.2| |One-way/free-floating carsharing|\n|2.3| |By conventional companies|\n|2.4| |Peer-to-peer carsharing|\n|2.5| |Fractional ownership|\n|\n|\n|3| |Difference from traditional car rentals|\n|4| |Technology|\n|5| |International terminology|\n|6| |See also|\n|7| |References|\n|8| |External links|\n|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|Early days|[|edit|]|\n|The first reference to carsharing in print identifies the |Selbstfahrergenossenschaft| carshare program in a |housing cooperative| that got underway in |Zürich| in 1948,|[2]|[3]| but there was no known formal development of the concept in the next few years. By the 1960s, as innovators, industrialists, cities, and public authorities studied the possibility of high-technology transportation – mainly computer-based small vehicle systems (almost all of them on separate guideways) – it was possible to spot some early precursors to present-day service ideas and control technologies.\n|The early 1970s saw the first whole-system carshare projects. The ProcoTip system in France lasted only about two years. A much more ambitious project called the |Witkar| was launched in Amsterdam by the founders of the 1965 |white bicycles| project. A sophisticated project based on small electric vehicles, electronic controls for reservations and return, and plans for a large number of stations covering the entire city, the project endured into the mid-1980s before finally being abandoned.\n|In July 1977, the first official British experiment in carsharing started in Suffolk. An office in Ipswich provided a |Share-a-Car| service for "putting motorists who are interested in sharing car journeys in touch with each other."|[4]| In 1978, the |Agricultural Research Council| granted the |University of Leeds| £16,577 "for an investigation and simulation of carsharing".|[5]| The scheme was not intended for different drivers of a single car but for a driver offering seats in his car.\n|The 1980s and first half of the 1990s was a "|coming of age|" period for carsharing, with continued slow growth, mainly of smaller non-profit systems, many in Switzerland and Germany|[6]| but also on a smaller scale in Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States.|[7]|\n|Carsharing in North America was founded in Quebec City in 1994 by Benoît Robert, with a company called Communauto that is still a leader in carsharing globally. Cycling advocate and environmentalist Claire Morissette (1950–2007) played a major role in its evolution starting in 1995, when Communauto established itself in Montreal as a private company. The company goal is to provide a convenient and economical alternative to owning a car.\n|In 2005, a novel form of car sharing service, the "Libre Service Integral", later known as Free Floating, has been introduce by VULOG and tested from 2007 in Antibes CiteVU mobility service, on the French riviera. An electric car paid by minute, when and how long I need, where I want and where I go". This service was added to Communauto in 2012.\n|\n|Boom in the United States|[|edit|]|\n| |Carsharing growth in the United States|\n|The first car-sharing company in the U.S. was CarSharing Portland, founded by Dave Brook in March by 1998 after a visit from Conrad Wagner of Mobility Switzerland. Conrad and Dave would also help establish |Flexcar| in Seattle, which launched in 2000, the same year as competitor Zipcar on the east coast. In April 2001 Carsharing Portland, then with 25 vehicles, merged with Flexcar, as its first expansion city. |[8]|[9]| |Zipcar|, (merged with Zipcar in 2007), and |City Car Club| were all started in 2000. |City CarShare| was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2001, as a non-profit. Several |car rental| companies launched their own carsharing services beginning in 2008, including Avis on Location by |Avis|, |Hertz on Demand| (formerly known as |Connect by Hertz|[10]|), operating in the U.S. and Europe; |Uhaul Car Share| owned by |U-Haul|, and |WeCar| by |Enterprise Rent-A-Car|.|[11]| By 2010, when various |peer-to-peer carsharing| systems were introduced. As of September\xa02012|[update]|[12]| Zipcar accounted for 80% of the U.S carsharing market|[11]|[13]| and half of all car-sharers worldwide|[14]| with 730,000 members sharing 11,000 vehicles.\n|In 2008, City CarShare introduced the first wheelchair carrying car share vehicle, the |Access Mobile|, specifically designed as a fleet vehicle shared with non-wheelchair users.\n|Carsharing is noted as a tool for achieving vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in the California Transport Plan (CTP) 2040 to reduce congestion and pollution.|[15]|\n|\n|Development and growth|[|edit|]|\n|\n|World cities by carshare fleet in 2018|[16]|\n|\n|\n|city\n|\n|fleet in units\n|\n|\n|Tokyo|\n|\n|19.800|\n|\n|\n|Moscow|\n|\n|16.500|\n|\n|\n|Beijing|\n|\n|15.400|\n|\n|\n|Shanghai|\n|\n|13.900|\n|\n|\n|Guangzhou|\n|\n|4.200|\n|\n|\n|Carsharing has also spread to other global markets with dense urban populations (such as Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey) given that population density is often a critical determinant of success for carsharing.|[17]| Successful carsharing development has tended to be associated mainly with densely populated areas, such as city centers and more recently university and other campuses. There are some programs (mostly in Europe) for providing services in lower density and rural areas.|[|citation needed|]| Low-density areas are considered more difficult to serve with carsharing because of the lack of alternative modes of transportation and the potentially larger distance that users must travel to reach the cars.\n|Many building developers are now incorporating share-cars into their developments as an added value to tenants, and municipal government bodies around the world are starting to stipulate the implementation of a carsharing service in new buildings, as a sustainability initiative. These trends have created a demand for a new model of carsharing – residential, private-access share-cars that are typically underwritten by the |Homeowner association|.|[|citation needed|]| In Germany a pilot project has been started by the semiconductor manufacturer |Infineon| to replace regular pool vehicles with a corporate carsharing system.|[18]| Replacing private automobiles with shared ones directly reduces demand for parking spaces. The fact that only a certain number of cars can be in use at any one time may reduce |traffic congestion| at |peak times|. Even more important for congestion, the strong metering of costs provides a cost incentive to drive less. With owned automobiles many expenses are |sunk costs| and thus independent of how much the car is driven (such as original purchase, insurance, registration, and some maintenance).\n|According to |Navigant Consulting|, global carsharing services revenue is expected to grow to |US$6.2| billion by 2020, with over 12 million members worldwide. The main factors driving the growth of carsharing are the rising levels of congestion faced by city dwellers; shifting generational mindsets about car ownership; the increasing costs of personal vehicle ownership; and a convergence of business models.|[19]|[20]| Carsharing operators increasingly opt to brand parts of their fleets with third-party advertising in order to increase revenue and improve competitiveness (|Transit media|).\n|For future applications, many carsharing companies invest in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (|PHEV|) to reduce petroleum consumption. One idea is to calculate and compensate all emissions on behalf of your drivers according to the Kyoto protocol, e.g. via reforestation schemes. The world\'s first certified |carbon neutral| carsharing service is Respiro carsharing in Madrid|[21]| and is also done by Australian p2p car sharing platform |Car Next Door|.\n|The most important technological innovation to affect the carsharing market is self-driving cars. It is expected that most self-driving vehicles won\'t be owned by individuals, but will rather be shared. Some companies, like |Ernst & Young|, have also started to use blockchain technology to record ownership, usage of shared vehicles and insurance information.|[22]|\n|In July 2018, |Volkswagen| announced its intention to launch an all-electric car-sharing service by 2019.|[23]| In August 2018, the carsharing startup |Getaround| rose $300 million from |Softbank|.|[24]| According to Moscow\'s authority, the number of carsharing journeys in the city averaged 30,000 a day between January and September 2018.|[25]|\n|\n|Global development and comparison in urban regions|[|edit|]|\n|Car-sharing is growing in urban regions as more people around the world adopt it.|[26]| The world\'s top cities for car-sharing in 2018 were\n|Tokyo| (|Japan|) with 19.8K vehicles, |Moscow| (|Russia|) with 16.5K vehicles, |Beijing| (|China|) with 15.4K vehicles, |Shanghai| (China) with 13.9K vehicles, |Guangzhou| (China) with 4.2K vehicles.|[27]|\n|\n|Types of carsharing|[|edit|]|\n|Generally, carsharing programs fall into one of four sharing models: round-trip, one-way, peer-to-peer, or fractional.\n|\n|Round-trip carsharing|[|edit|]|\n|Members begin and end their trip at the same location, often paying by the hour, mile, or both.\n|\n|One-way/free-floating carsharing|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |One-way carsharing|\n|One-way carsharing enables users to begin and end their trip at different locations through free floating zones or station-based models with designated parking locations.|[28]| As of 2017, free-floating carsharing is available in 55 cities and 20 countries worldwide, with 40,000 vehicles and serving 5.6 million users, with |Europe| and |North America| representing the majority of the market. In Europe, free floating services took up more than 65 percent in carsharing membership.|[29]|\n|The service is expected to reach 14.3 million users with more than 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2022.|[30]|\n|\n|By conventional companies|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Company car|\n|In |corporate car sharing|, the company shares the vehicles and allows multiple employees (rather than just one) to make use of a company car, at times when they actually need it. The vehicles are made available from a |corporate car sharing pool|, and shared for a fixed or flexible period of time.|[31]| One shared car could replace up to 8 non-shared cars. However, car-sharing does involves an additional processing and associated costs.|[32]| Still, it  reduces fleet-related costs over the long term and allow employees to save not only on costs but also on time.|[33]|[|clarification needed|]|\n|\n|Peer-to-peer carsharing|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Peer-to-peer carsharing|\n|Peer-to-peer carsharing, sometimes referred to as P2P or Personal Vehicle Sharing,|[28]| operates similarly to round-trip carsharing in trip and payment type. However, the vehicles themselves are typically privately owned or leased with the sharing system operated by a third-party.\n|\n|Fractional ownership|[|edit|]|\n|Fractional ownership allows users to co-own a vehicle and share its costs and use.|[34]|\nNeighborhood fractional ownership carsharing is often promoted as an alternative to owning a car where |public transit|, walking, and |cycling| can be used most of the time and a car is only necessary for out-of-town trips, moving large items, or special occasions. It can also be an alternative to owning multiple cars for households with more than one driver.|[35]|\n|\n|Difference from traditional car rentals|[|edit|]|\n|Carsharing differs from traditional car rentals in the following ways:\n|\n|Carsharing is not limited by office hours|\n|Reservation, pickup, and return is all self-service|\n|Vehicles can be rented by the minute, by the hour, as well as by the day|\n|Users are members and have been pre-approved to drive (background driving checks have been performed and a payment mechanism has been established).|\n|Vehicle locations are distributed throughout the service area, and often located for access by |public transport|.|\n|Insurance: (this section is US specific) state minimum liability insurance (only $5000 in some states), comprehensive and collision insurance. They do not provide uninsured, under-insured or personal injury protection insurance.|\n|Fuel costs are included in the rates.|\n|Vehicles are not serviced (cleaning, fueling) after each use, although certain programs (such as |Car2Go| or |GoGet|) continuously clean and fuel their fleet.|\n|With carsharing, individuals have access to private cars without having costs and responsibilities associated with car ownership (except for fractional ownerships).|[36]| Some carshare operations (CSOs) cooperate with local car rental firms, in particular in situations wherein classic rental may be the cheaper option.\n|The insurance policies on carsharing greatly varies among companies, but all carsharing firms provide insurance that at least meets the legal minimum requirements for the given region of operation.|[|citation needed|]| Rob Lieber of |The New York Times| has criticized carsharing firms such as Zipcar for the paltry coverage afforded carsharing drivers.|[37]|\n|\n|Technology|[|edit|]|\n| |Yandex.Drive|, the largest car sharing operator in Russia, uses mobile tankers to refuel its vehicle fleet. The company claims that specific cars for refueling are chosen by special algorithm as well as the most optimal routes to them.|[38]|\n|The technology of CSOs varies enormously, from simple manual systems using key boxes and log books to increasingly complex computer-based systems (e.g. partially automated and fully automated systems) with supporting |software packages| that handle a growing array of back office functions.|[39]| The simplest CSOs have only one or two pick-up points, but more advanced systems allow cars to be picked up and dropped off at any available public parking space within a designated operating area.\n|Once the reservations are completed and confirmed, the car will then be delivered at the time and place scheduled. There will be a small card reader mounted on the windshield. Once the customer places their membership card on the reader, it will use what is called |blink technology| to activate the time and unlock the car. The reader will not work until it is time for that specific reservation. The keys can then be found somewhere inside the car such as the glove compartment. Depending on the company, the customer may be provided with a key to a lock box that contains the ignition key itself.|[40]| In some cases the car can be unlocked using a mobile phone and the car can even be started using the phone as well.\n|Many car sharing networks price their services as a small start up fee and then a mileage fee for the distance driven in the car. Usually the app will include insurance, gas cards, and upkeep to their fleet of cars at no additional charge to the customer.\n|\n|International terminology|[|edit|]|\n|\xa0|United Kingdom|: "car clubs".|[41]| In the UK, "car sharing" refers to what is called "|carpooling|" or "|ride sharing|" in the US, namely the shared use of a car for a specific journey, in particular for commuting to work, often by people who each have a car but travel together to save costs.|[42]|\n|\xa0|South Africa|: "|lift scheme|".|\n|\xa0|India|: "self-drive."|[43]|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Sharing economy|\n|Alternatives to car use|\n|Car rental|\n|Carpool|\n|Ecoleasing|\n|Fleet vehicle|\n|List of carsharing organizations|\n|Ridesharing company|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |Москва вышла в мировые лидеры по парку каршеринга|\n|\n|^| |"The CarSharing Handbook (Part 1)"|.

It is a |vehicular communication system| that incorporates other more specific types of communication as V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure), V2N (vehicle-to-network), V2V (|vehicle-to-vehicle|), V2P (vehicle-to-pedestrian), V2D (|vehicle-to-device|).\n|The main motivations for V2X are |road safety|, |traffic efficiency|, |energy savings|, and |mass surveillance|.  The U.S. |NHTSA| estimates a minimum of 13% reduction in traffic accidents if a V2V system were implemented, resulting in 439,000 fewer crashes per year.|[1]|  There are two types of V2X communication technology depending on the underlying technology being used: (1) |WLAN|-based, and (2) |cellular|-based.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |History|\n|2| |Technology overview|\n|\n|2.1| |802.11p (DSRC)|\n|2.2| |3GPP (C-V2X)|\n|\n|\n|3| |Use cases|\n|4| |Standardisation history|\n|\n|4.1| |IEEE 802.11p|\n|4.2| |3GPP|\n|\n|\n|5| |Regulatory history|\n|\n|5.1| |United States|\n|5.2| |Europe|\n|\n|\n|6| |Spectrum allocation|\n|7| |Consideration in the transition period|\n|8| |Further reading|\n|9| |See also|\n|10| |References|\n|11| |External links|\n|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|The history of working on vehicle-to-vehicle communication projects to increase safety, reduce accidents and driver assistance can be traced back to the 1970s with projects such as the US |Electronic Road Guidance System (ERGS)| and Japan\'s CACS.|[2]| Most milestones in the history of vehicle networks originate from the United States, Europe, and Japan.|[2]|\n|Standardization of WLAN-based V2X supersedes that of cellular-based V2X systems. |IEEE| first published the specification of WLAN-based V2X (|IEEE 802.11p|) in 2010.|[3]| It supports direct communication between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I).  This technology is referred to as Dedicated Short Range Communication (|DSRC|).  |DSRC| uses the underlying radio communication provided by 802.11p.\n|In 2016, Toyota became the first automaker globally to introduce automobiles equipped with V2X.  These vehicles use |DSRC| technology and are only for sale in Japan.  In 2017, GM became the second automaker to introduce V2X.  GM sells a Cadillac model in the United States that also is equipped with |DSRC| V2X.\n|In 2016, |3GPP| published V2X specifications based on |LTE| as the underlying technology. It is generally referred to as "cellular V2X" (C-V2X) to differentiate itself from the 802.11p based V2X technology.  In addition to the direct communication (V2V, V2I), C-V2X also supports wide area communication over a cellular network (V2N).\n|As of December 2017, a European automotive manufacturer has announced to deploy V2X technology based on 802.11p from 2019.|[4]| While some studies and analysis in 2017|[4]| and 2018,|[5]| all performed by the |5G Automotive Association| (5GAA) – the industry organisation supporting and developing the C-V2X technology – indicate that cellular-based C-V2X technology in direct communication mode is superior to 802.11p in multiple aspects, such as performance, communication range, and reliability, many of these claims are disputed, e.g. in a whitepaper published by NXP,|[6]| one of the companies active in the 802.11p based V2X technology,\nbut also published by peer-reviewed journals.|[7]|\n|\n|Technology overview|[|edit|]|\n|802.11p (DSRC)|[|edit|]|\n|The original V2X communication uses |WLAN| technology and works directly between vehicles (V2V) as well as vehicles and traffic infrastructure (V2I), which form a |vehicular ad-hoc network| as two V2X senders come within each other\'s range. Hence it does not require any communication infrastructure for vehicles to communicate, which is key to assure safety in remote or little-developed areas. WLAN is particularly well-suited for |V2X communication|, due to its low latency. It transmits messages known as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM)  or Basic Safety Message (BSM), and Decentralised Environmental Notification Messages (DENM). Other roadside infrastructure related messages are Signal Phase and Timing Message (SPAT), In Vehicle Information Message (IVI), and Service Request Message (SRM). The data volume of these messages is very low. The radio technology is part of the WLAN |IEEE 802.11| family of standards and known in the US as Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) and in Europe as ITS-G5.|[8]| To complement the direct communication mode, vehicles can be equipped with traditional cellular communication technologies, supporting V2N based services. This extension with V2N was achieved in Europe under the C-ITS platform umbrella|[9]| with cellular systems and broadcast systems (TMC/DAB+).\n|\n|3GPP (C-V2X)|[|edit|]|\n|More recent V2X communication uses |cellular networks| and is called |cellular V2X| (or C-V2X) to differentiate it from the WLAN-based V2X.  There have been multiple industry organizations, such as the |5G Automotive Association| (5GAA) promoting C-V2X due to its advantages over WLAN based V2X (without considering disadvantages at the same time).|[10]| C-V2X is initially defined as |LTE| in |3GPP| Release 14 and is designed to operate in several modes:\n|\n|Device-to-device (V2V or V2I), and|\n|Device-to-network (V2N).|\n|In 3GPP Release 15, the V2X functionalities are expanded to support |5G|. C-V2X includes support of both direct communication between vehicles (V2V) and traditional cellular-network based communication. Also, C-V2X provides a migration path to 5G based systems and services, which implies incompatibility and higher costs compared to 4G based solutions.\n|The direct communication between vehicle and other devices (V2V, V2I) uses so-called PC5 interface. PC5 refers to a reference point where the User Equipment (UE), i.e. mobile handset, directly communicates with another UE over the direct channel. In this case, the communication with the |base station| is not required. In system architectural level, proximity service (ProSe) is the feature that specifies the architecture of the direct communication between UEs.  In 3GPP RAN specifications, "sidelink" is the terminology to refer to the direct communication over PC5. PC5 interface was originally defined to address the needs of mission-critical communication for public safety community (Public Safety-LTE, or PS-LTE) in release 13. The motivation of the mission-critical communication was to allow law enforcement agencies or emergency rescue to use the LTE communication even when the infrastructure is not available, such as natural disaster scenario.  In release 14 onwards, the use of PC5 interface has been expanded to meet various market needs, such as communication involving wearable devices such as |smartwatch|.  In C-V2X, PC5 interface is re-applied to the direct communication in V2V and V2I.\n|The Cellular V2X mode 4 communication relies on a distributed resource allocation scheme, namely sensing-based semipersistent scheduling which schedules radio resources in a stand-alone fashion in each user equipment (UE).|[11]| |[12]|\n|[13]|\n|In addition to the direct communication over PC5, C-V2X also allows the C-V2X device to use the cellular network connection in the traditional manner over Uu interface.  Uu refers to the logical interface between the UE and the base station. This is generally referred to as vehicle-to-network (V2N). V2N is a unique use case to C-V2X and does not exist in 802.11p based V2X given that the latter supports direct communication only. However, similar to WLAN based V2X also in case of C-V2X, two communication radios are required to be able to communicate simultaneously via a PC5 interface with nearby stations and via the UU interface with the network.\n|While 3GPP defines the data transport features that enable V2X, it does not include V2X semantic content but proposes usage of ITS-G5 standards like CAM, DENM, BSM, etc. over 3GPP V2X data transport features.|[14]|\n|\n|Use cases|[|edit|]|\n|Through its instant communication V2X allows road safety applications such as (non-exhaustive list):\n|\n|Forward collision warning|\n|Lane change warning|/blind spot warning|\n|Emergency electric brake light warning|\n|Intersection movement assist|\n|Emergency vehicle| approaching|\n|Roadworks| warning|\n|Platooning|\n|The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\'s (NHTSA) report “Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications: Readiness of V2V Technology for Application“|[15]| lists the initial use cases envisioned for the US. European standardisation body |ETSI| and |SAE| published standards on what they see as use cases.|[16]|[17]| Early use cases focus on road safety and efficiency.|[18]| New and advanced use cases are introduced by organizations such as 3GPP, 5GAA, and 5GCAR, these use cases address high levels of automation.|[2]|\n|In the medium term V2X is perceived as a key enabler for autonomous driving, assuming it would be allowed to intervene into the actual driving. In that case vehicles would be able to join platoons, the way HGVs do. With the advent of connected and autonomous mobility, V2X discussions are seen to play an important role, especially in the context of teleoperations for autonomous vehicles |[19]| and platooning |[20]| |[21]|\n|\n|Standardisation history|[|edit|]|\n|IEEE 802.11p|[|edit|]|\n|WLAN-based V2X communication is based on a set of standards drafted by the |American Society for Testing and Materials| (ASTM). The ASTM E 2213 series of standards looks at wireless communication for high-speed information exchange between vehicles themselves as well as road infrastructure. The first standard of this series was published 2002. Here the acronym Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) was first used for V2X communication.\n|From 2004 onwards the |Institute Electrical and Electronics Engineers| (IEEE) started to work on wireless access for vehicles under the umbrella of their standards family IEEE 802.11 for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). Their initial standard for wireless communication for vehicles is known as |IEEE 802.11p| and is based on the work done by the ASTM. Later on in 2012 |IEEE 802.11p| was incorporated in IEEE 802.11.\n|Around 2007 when |IEEE 802.11p| got stable, IEEE started to develop the 1609.x standards family standardising applications and a security framework|[22]| (IEEE uses the term WAVE), and soon after |SAE| started to specify standards for V2V communication applications. SAE uses the term DSRC for this technology (this is how the term was coined in the US). In parallel at ETSI the technical committee for |Intelligent transportation system| (ITS) was founded and started to produce standards for protocols and applications|[23]| (ETSI coined the term ITS-G5). All these standards are based on IEEE 802.11p technology.\n|Between 2012 and 2013, the Japanese |Association of Radio Industries and Businesses| (ARIB) specified, also based on IEEE 802.11, a V2V and V2I communication system in the 700\xa0MHz frequency band.|[24]|\n|In 2015 |ITU| published as summary of all V2V and V2I standards that are worldwide in use, comprising the systems specified by ETSI, IEEE, ARIB, and TTA (Republic of Korea, Telecommunication Technology Association).|[25]|\n|\n|3GPP|[|edit|]|\n|3GPP| started standardization work of cellular V2X (C-V2X) in Release 14 in 2014. It is based on LTE as the underlying technology. Specifications were published in 2017. Because this C-V2X functionalities are based on LTE, it is often referred to as LTE-V2X. The scope of functionalities supported by C-V2X includes both direct communication (V2V, V2I) as well as wide area cellular network communication (V2N).\n|In Release 15, 3GPP continued its C-V2X standardization to be based on 5G.  Specifications are published in 2018 as Release 15 comes to completion. To indicate the underlying technology, the term 5G-V2X is often used in contrast to LTE-based V2X (LTE-V2X).  Either case, C-V2X is the generic terminology that refers to the V2X technology using the cellular technology irrespective of the specific generation of technology.\n|In Release 16, 3GPP further enhances the C-V2X functionality. The work is currently in progress. In this way, C-V2X is inherently future-proof by supporting migration path to 5G.\n|Study and analysis were done|[4]|[5]| to compare the effectiveness of direct communication technologies between LTE-V2X PC5 and 802.11p from the perspective of accident avoided and reduction in fatal and serious injuries. The study shows that LTE-V2X achieves higher level of accident avoidance and reduction in injury.|[4]| It also indicates LTE-V2X performs higher percentage of successful packet delivery and communication range. Another link-level and system-level simulation result indicates that, to achieve the same link performance for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) are achievable by LTE-V2X PC5 interface compared to IEEE 802.11p.|[5]|\n|Cellular-based V2X solution also leads to the possibility of further protecting other types of road users (e.g. pedestrian, cyclist) by having PC5 interface to be integrated into smartphones, effectively integrating those road users into the overall C-ITS solution.  Vehicle-to-person (V2P) includes Vulnerable Road User (VRU) scenarios to detect pedestrians and cyclists to avoid accident and injuries involving those road users.\n|As both direct communication and wide area cellular network communication are defined in the same standard (3GPP), both modes of communication will likely be integrated into a single chipset.  Commercialization of those chipsets further enhances economy of scale and leads to possibilities to wider range of business models and services using both types of communications.\n|\n|Regulatory history|[|edit|]|\n|United States|[|edit|]|\n|In 1999 the US |Federal Communications Commission| (FCC) allocated 75\xa0MHz in the spectrum of 5.850-5.925\xa0GHz for intelligent transport systems.|[26]|\n|Since then the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) has been working with a range of stakeholders on V2X. In 2012 a pre-deployment project was implemented in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 2800 vehicles covering cars, motorcycles, buses and HGV of different brands took part using equipment by different manufacturers.|[27]| The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) saw this model deployment as proof that road safety could be improved and that WAVE standard technology was interoperable. In August 2014 NHTSA published a report arguing vehicle-to-vehicle technology was technically proven as ready for deployment.|[15]| On 20 August 2014 the NHTSA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register,|[28]| arguing that the safety benefits of V2X communication could only be achieved if a significant part of the vehicles fleet was equipped. Because of the lack of an immediate benefit for early adopters, the NHTSA proposed a mandatory introduction. On 25 June 2015 the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the matter,|[29]| where again the NHTSA, as well as other stakeholders argued the case for V2X.|[30]|\n|On November 18, 2020, the FCC reallocated 45 MHz in the 5.850–5.895\xa0GHz range to |Wi-Fi|, and the rest of the V2X band to C-V2X, citing the failure of DSRC to take off.|[31]| The advocacy organizations |ITS America| and |American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials| sued the FCC, arguing that the decision harms users of DSRC; on August 12, 2022, a federal court permitted the reassignment to go ahead.|[32]|\n|\n|Europe|[|edit|]|\n|To acquire EU-wide spectrum, radio applications require a harmonised standard, in case of ITS-G5 ETSI EN 302 571,|[33]| first published in 2008. A harmonised standard in turn requires an ETSI System Reference Document, here ETSI TR 101 788.|[34]| Commission Decision 2008/671/EC harmonises the use of the 5 875-5 905\xa0MHz frequency band for transport safety ITS applications.|[35]| In 2010 the ITS Directive 2010/40/EU|[36]| was adopted. It aims to assure that ITS applications are interoperable and can operate across national borders, it defines priority areas for secondary legislation, which cover V2X and requires technologies to be mature. In 2014 the European Commission\'s industry stakeholder “C-ITS Deployment Platform” started working on a regulatory framework for V2X in the EU.|[37]| It identified key approaches to an EU-wide V2X security Public Key infrastructure (PKI) and data protection, as well as facilitating a mitigation standard|[38]| to prevent radio interference between ITS-G5 based V2X and road charging systems. The European Commission recognised ITS-G5 as the initial communication technology in its 5G Action Plan|[39]| and the accompanying explanatory document,|[40]| to form a communication environment consisting of ITS-G5 and cellular communication as envisioned by EU Member States.|[41]| Various pre-deployment projects exist at EU or EU Member State level, such as SCOOP@F, the Testfeld Telematik, the digital testbed Autobahn, the Rotterdam-Vienna ITS Corridor, Nordic Way, COMPASS4D or C-ROADS.|[42]| There exist real scenarios of implementation V2X standard as well. The first commercial project where V2X standard is used for Intersection movement assist use-case. It has been realized in |Brno| City / |Czech Republic| where 80 pcs of cross intersections are controlled by V2X communication standard from public transport vehicles of municipality Brno.|[43]|\n|\n|Spectrum allocation|[|edit|]|\n|Spectrum allocation for C-ITS in various countries is shown in the following table. Due to the standardization of V2X in 802.11p preceding C-V2X standardization in |3GPP|, spectrum allocation was originally intended for the 802.11p based system. However, the regulations are technology neutral so that the deployment of C-V2X is not excluded.\n|In 2022, US Federal Courts told the FCC that it could reallocate 45MHz of V2X spectrum to wireless and cellular carriers, citing years of no use by V2X constituents.\n|\n|\n|\n|Country|\n|Spectrum (MHz)|\n|Allocated bandwidth (MHz)\n|\n|\n|Australia|\n|5855 – 5925|\n|70\n|\n|\n|China|\n|5905 - 5925 (trials)|\n|20\n|\n|\n|Europe|\n|5875 – 5905|\n|30\n|\n|\n|Japan|\n|755.5-764.5 and 5770 – 5850|\n|9 and 80\n|\n|\n|Korea|\n|5855 – 5925|\n|70\n|\n|\n|Singapore|\n|5875 – 5925|\n|50\n|\n|\n|USA|\n|5895 - 5925|\n|30\n|\n|Consideration in the transition period|[|edit|]|\n|The deployment of V2X technology (either C-V2X or 802.11p based products) will occur gradually over time. New cars will be equipped with either of the two technologies starting around 2020 and its proportion on the road is expected to increase gradually. The Volkswagen Golf 8th generation was the first passenger car to be fitted with V2X technology powered by NXP technology.|[44]| In the meantime, existing (legacy) vehicles will continue to exist on the road. This implies that the V2X capable vehicles will need to co-exist with non-V2X (legacy) vehicles or with V2X vehicles of incompatible technology.\n|The main obstacles to its adoption are legal issues and the fact that, unless almost all vehicles adopt it, its effectiveness is limited.|[45]| British weekly "The Economist" argues that autonomous driving is more driven by regulations than by technology.|[46]|\n|However, more recent study|[4]|  indicates that there are benefits in reducing traffic accidents even during the transitional period in which the technology is being adopted in the market.\n|\n|Further reading|[|edit|]|\n|Many books and papers have been written in the topic:\n|\n|Toward Reliable and Scalable Internet-of-Vehicles: Performance Analysis and Resource Management. |[47]|\n|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Vehicular communication systems|\n|IEEE 802.11p|\n|Cellular V2X|\n|V2V|\n|V2G|\n|V2D|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |"Vehicle-To-Vehicle Communication Technology For Light Vehicles"| |(PDF)|. |www.google.com|. p.\xa0e10|.

Together with other emerging automotive technologies such as autonomous driving, connected vehicles and shared mobility, electric cars form a future mobility vision called Autonomous, Connected, Electric and Shared (ACES) Mobility.|[12]|\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Terminology|\n|2| |History|\n|\n|2.1| |Early developments|\n|2.2| |Modern electric cars|\n|\n|\n|3| |Economics|\n|\n|3.1| |Manufacturing cost|\n|3.2| |Total cost of ownership|\n|\n|3.2.1| |Purchase cost|\n|3.2.2| |Running costs|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|4| |Environmental aspects|\n|\n|4.1| |Public opinion|\n|\n|\n|5| |Performance|\n|\n|5.1| |Acceleration and drivetrain design|\n|\n|\n|6| |Energy efficiency|\n|\n|6.1| |Cabin heating and cooling|\n|\n|\n|7| |Safety|\n|\n|7.1| |Heaviness|\n|7.2| |Stability|\n|7.3| |Risk of fire|\n|\n|\n|8| |Controls|\n|9| |Batteries|\n|\n|9.1| |Range|\n|9.2| |Charging|\n|\n|9.2.1| |Connectors|\n|9.2.2| |Home charging|\n|9.2.3| |Public charging|\n|\n|9.2.3.1| |Electric roads|\n|\n|\n|9.2.4| |Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering|\n|\n|\n|9.3| |Lifespan|\n|\n|\n|10| |Currently available electric cars|\n|\n|10.1| |Highway capable|\n|10.2| |Electric cars by country|\n|\n|\n|11| |Government policies and incentives|\n|12| |EV plans from major manufacturers|\n|13| |Forecasts|\n|14| |See also|\n|15| |References|\n|16| |External links|\n|\n|\n|Terminology|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Vehicle classification by propulsion system|, |Plug-in electric vehicle §\xa0Terminology|, and |Battery electric vehicle|\n|The term "electric car" typically refers specifically to |battery electric vehicles| (BEVs) or all-electric cars, a type of |electric vehicle| (EV) that has an onboard |rechargeable battery pack| that can be plugged in and charged from the |electric grid|, and the electricity stored on the vehicle is the |only| energy source that provide propulsion for the wheels. The term generally refers to highway-capable automobiles, but there are also low-speed electric vehicles with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads. The latter are classified as |Neighborhood Electric Vehicles| (NEVs) in the |United States|,|[13]| and as electric |motorised quadricycles| in |Europe|.|[14]|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |History of the electric vehicle|\n|Early developments|[|edit|]|\n|Robert Anderson| is often credited with inventing the first electric car some time between 1832 and 1839.|[15]|\n|The following experimental electric cars appeared during the 1880s:\n|\n|In 1881, |Gustave Trouvé| presented an electric car at the |Exposition internationale d\'Électricité de Paris|.|[16]|\n|In 1884, over 20 years before the |Ford Model T|, |Thomas Parker| built an electric car in |Wolverhampton| using his own specially-designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries, although the only documentation is a photograph from 1895.|[17]|[18]|[19]|\n|In 1888, the German |Andreas Flocken| designed the |Flocken Elektrowagen|, regarded by some as the first "real" electric car.|[20]|[21]|[22]|\n|Electricity was among the preferred methods for automobile propulsion in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, providing a level of comfort and an ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline-driven cars of the time.|[23]| The electric vehicle fleet peaked at approximately 30,000 vehicles at the turn of the 20th century.|[24]|\n|In 1897, electric cars first found commercial use as |taxis| in Britain and in the United States. In London, |Walter Bersey|\'s |electric cabs| were the first self-propelled vehicles for hire at a time when cabs were horse-drawn.|[25]| In New York City, a fleet of twelve |hansom cabs| and one |brougham|, based on the design of the |Electrobat II|, formed part of a project funded in part by the |Electric Storage Battery Company| of |Philadelphia|.|[26]| During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the United States included Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, |Bailey Electric|, and |Detroit Electric|. Their electric vehicles were quieter than gasoline-powered ones, and did not require gear changes.|[27]|[28]|\n|Six electric cars held the |land speed record| in the 19th century.|[29]| The last of them was the rocket-shaped |La Jamais Contente|, driven by |Camille Jenatzy|, which broke the 100\xa0km/h (62\xa0mph) speed barrier by reaching a top speed of 105.88\xa0km/h (65.79\xa0mph) in 1899.\n|Electric cars remained popular until advances in |internal-combustion engine| (ICE) cars and |mass production| of cheaper gasoline- and |diesel|-powered vehicles led to a decline. ICE cars\' much quicker refueling times and cheaper production-costs made them more popular. However, a decisive moment came with the introduction in 1912 of the electric |starter motor|[30]| that replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as |hand-cranking|.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Gustave Trouvé|\'s personal electric vehicle (1881), the world\'s first publicly presented full-scale electric car\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Early electric car built by |Thomas Parker| - photo from 1895|[31]|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|"|La Jamais Contente|", 1899\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|NASA|\'s |Lunar Roving Vehicles| were battery-driven\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The |General Motors EV1|, one of the cars introduced due to a |California Air Resources Board| (CARB) mandate, had a range of 260\xa0km (160 miles) with |NiMH batteries| in 1999.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The |Tesla Roadster| helped inspire the modern generation of electric vehicles.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Modern electric cars|[|edit|]|\n|In the early 1990s the |California Air Resources Board| (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal of a move to |zero-emissions vehicles| such as electric vehicles.|[32]|[33]| In response, automakers developed electric models. These early cars were eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market, because of a massive campaign by the US automakers to discredit the idea of electric cars.|[34]|\n|California| electric-auto maker |Tesla Motors| began development in 2004 of what would become the |Tesla Roadster|, first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster was the first highway-legal all-electric car to use |lithium-ion battery| cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 320\xa0km (200 miles) per charge.|[35]|\n|Better Place|, a |venture-backed| company based in |Palo Alto, California|, but steered from |Israel|, developed and sold battery charging and |battery swapping| services for electric cars. The company was publicly launched on 29 October 2007 and announced deployment of |electric vehicle networks| in |Israel|, |Denmark| and |Hawaii| in 2008 and 2009. The company planned to deploy the infrastructure on a country-by-country basis. In January 2008, Better Place announced a |memorandum of understanding| with |Renault-Nissan| to build the world\'s first Electric Recharge Grid Operator (ERGO) model for Israel. Under the agreement, Better Place would build the electric recharge grid and |Renault-Nissan| would provide the |electric vehicles|. Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company\'s financial difficulties were caused by mismanagement, wasteful efforts to establish toeholds and run pilots in too many countries, the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, and a market penetration far lower than originally predicted.|[36]|\n|The |Mitsubishi i-MiEV|, launched in 2009 in Japan, was the first highway-legal |series production| electric car,|[37]| and also the first all-electric car to sell more than 10,000 units. Several months later, the |Nissan Leaf|, launched in 2010, surpassed the i MiEV as the best selling all-electric car at that time.|[38]|\n|Starting in 2008, a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries, and the desire to reduce |greenhouse-gas emissions| and to improve urban |air quality|.|[39]| During the 2010s, the |electric vehicle industry in China| expanded greatly with government support.|[40]| The subsidies introduced by the Chinese government will however be cut by 20 to 30% and phased out completely before 2023. Several automakers marked up the prices of their electric vehicles in anticipation of the subsidy adjustment, including Tesla, Volkswagen and Guangzhou-based GAC Group, which counts Fiat, Honda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, and Toyota as foreign partners.|[41]|\n|In July 2019 US-based |Motor Trend| magazine awarded the fully-electric Tesla Model S the title "ultimate car of the year".|[42]| In March 2020 the |Tesla Model 3| passed the Nissan Leaf to become the world\'s all-time best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered;|[10]| it reached the milestone of 1\xa0million global sales in June 2021.|[11]|\n|In the third quarter of 2021, the |Alliance for Automotive Innovation| reported that sales of electric vehicles had reached six percent of all US light-duty automotive sales, the highest volume of EV sales ever recorded at 187,000 vehicles. This was an 11% sales increase, as opposed to a 1.3% increase in gasoline and diesel-powered units. The report indicated that California was the US leader in EV with nearly 40% of US purchases, followed by Florida – 6%, Texas – 5% and New York 4.4%.|[43]|\n|Electric companies from the Middle East have been designing electric cars. Oman\'s |Mays Motors| have developed the |Mays i E1| which is expected to begin production in 2023. Built from carbon fibre, it has a range of about 560\xa0km (350 miles) and can accelerate from 0–130\xa0km/h (0–80\xa0mph) in about 4 secs.|[44]| In Turkey, the EV company |Togg| is starting production of its electric vehicles. Batteries will be created in a joint venture with the Chinese company |Farasis Energy|.|[45]|\n|\n|Economics|[|edit|]|\n|Manufacturing cost|[|edit|]|\n|The most expensive part of an electric car is its battery. The price decreased from €605 per kWh in 2010, to €170 in 2017, to €100 in 2019.|[46]|[47]| When designing an electric vehicle, manufacturers may find that for low production, converting existing |platforms| may be cheaper, as development cost is lower; however, for higher production, a dedicated platform may be preferred to optimize design, and cost.|[48]|\n|\n|Total cost of ownership|[|edit|]|\n|In the EU and US, but not yet China, the total cost of ownership of recent electric cars is cheaper than that of equivalent gasoline cars, due to lower fueling and maintenance costs.|[2]|[3]|[49]|\n|The greater the distance driven per year, the more likely the |total cost of ownership| for an electric car will be less than for an equivalent ICE car.|[50]| The break even distance varies by country depending on the taxes, subsidies, and different costs of energy.  In some countries the comparison may vary by city, as a type of car may have different charges to enter different cities; for example, in |England|, |London| charges ICE cars more than |Birmingham| does.|[51]|\n|\n|Purchase cost|[|edit|]|\n|Several national and local governments have established |EV incentives| to reduce the purchase price of electric cars and other plug-ins.|[52]|[53]|[54]|[55]|\n|As of 2020|[update]|, the |electric vehicle battery| is more than a quarter of the total cost of the car.|[56]| Purchase prices are expected to drop below those of new ICE cars when battery costs fall below |US$100| per kWh, which is forecast to be in the mid-2020s.|[57]|[58]|\n|Leasing or subscriptions are popular in some countries,|[59]|[60]| depending somewhat on national taxes and subsidies,|[61]| and end of lease cars are expanding the second hand market.|[62]|\n|In a June 2022 report by AlixPartners,  the cost for raw materials on an average EV rose from $3,381 in March 2020 to $8,255 in May 2022. The cost increase voice is attributed mainly to lithium, nickel, and cobalt.|[63]|\n|\n|Running costs|[|edit|]|\n|Electricity almost always costs less than gasoline per kilometer travelled, but the price of electricity often varies depending on where and what time of day the car is charged.|[64]|[65]| Cost savings are also affected by the price of gasoline which can vary by location.|[66]|\n|\n|Environmental aspects|[|edit|]|\n| |The |Salar de Uyuni| in |Bolivia| is one of the largest known |lithium| reserves in the world.|[67]|[68]|\n|Main article: |Environmental aspects of the electric car|\n|Electric cars have several benefits when replacing ICE cars, including a significant reduction of local air pollution, as they do not emit |exhaust pollutants| such as |volatile organic compounds|, |hydrocarbons|, |carbon monoxide|, |ozone|, |lead|, and various |oxides of nitrogen|.|[69]| Similar to ICE vehicles, electric cars emit particulates from tyre and brake wear|[70]| which may damage health,|[71]| although regenerative braking in electric cars means less brake dust.|[72]| More research is needed on non-exhaust particulates.|[73]| The sourcing of fossil fuels (oil well to gasoline tank) causes further damage as well as use of resources during the extraction and refinement processes.\n|Depending on the production process and the source of the electricity to charge the vehicle, emissions may be partly shifted from cities to the plants that generate electricity and produce the car as well as to the transportation of material.|[32]| The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the |emissions| of the electricity source and the efficiency of the vehicle. For |electricity from the grid|, the life-cycle emissions vary depending on the proportion of |coal-fired power|, but are always less than ICE cars.|[74]|\n|The cost of installing charging infrastructure has been estimated to be repaid by health cost savings in less than three years.|[75]| According to a 2020 study, balancing |lithium| supply and demand for the rest of the century will require good recycling systems, vehicle-to-grid integration, and lower lithium intensity of transportation.|[76]|\n|Some activists and journalists have raised concerns over the perceived lack of impact of electric cars in solving the climate change crisis|[77]| compared to other, less popularized methods.|[78]| These concerns have largely centered around the existence of less carbon-intensive and more efficient forms of transportation such as |active mobility|,|[79]| |mass transit| and e-scooters and the continuation of a system designed for cars first.|[80]|\n|\n|Public opinion|[|edit|]|\n|A 2022 survey found that 33% of car buyers in Europe will opt for a petrol or diesel car when purchasing a new vehicle. 67% of the respondents mentioned opting for the hybrid or electric version.|[81]|[82]| More specifically, it found that electric cars are only preferred by 28% of Europeans, making them the least preferred type of vehicle. 39% of Europeans tend to prefer |hybrid vehicles|, while 33% prefer petrol or |diesel vehicles|.|[83]|[84]|\n|44% Chinese car buyers, on the other hand, are the most likely to buy an electric car, while 38% of Americans would opt for a hybrid car, 33% would prefer petrol or diesel, while only 29% would go for an electric car.|[83]|[85]|\n|Specifically for the |EU|, 47% of car buyers over 65 years old are likely to purchase a hybrid vehicle, while 31% of younger respondents do not consider hybrid vehicles a good option. 35% would rather opt for a petrol or diesel vehicle, and 24% for an electric car instead of a hybrid.|[83]|[86]|\n|In the EU, only 13% of the total population do not plan on owning a vehicle at all.|[83]|\n|\n|Performance|[|edit|]|\n|Acceleration and drivetrain design|[|edit|]|\n| |Typical "skateboard" layout with the battery as floor and a motor at one or both axles|\n|Electric motors can provide high |power-to-weight ratios|. Batteries can be designed to supply the electrical current needed to support these motors. Electric motors have a flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, most electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.\n|Many electric cars have faster acceleration than average ICE cars, largely due to reduced drivetrain frictional losses and the more quickly-available torque of an electric motor.|[87]| However, NEVs may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors.\n|Electric vehicles can also use a |motor in each wheel hub| or next to the wheels, this is rare but claimed to be safer.|[88]| Electric vehicles that lack an |axle|, |differential|, or |transmission| can have less drivetrain inertia. Some |direct current motor|-equipped drag racer EVs have simple two-speed |manual transmissions| to improve top speed.|[89]| The concept electric supercar |Rimac Concept One| claims it can go from 0–97\xa0km/h (0–60\xa0mph) in 2.5 seconds. Tesla claims the upcoming |Tesla Roadster| will go 0–60\xa0mph (0–97\xa0km/h) in 1.9 seconds.|[90]|\n|\n|Energy efficiency|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Electric car energy efficiency|\n| |Energy efficiency of electric cars in towns and on motorways according to the |DoE|\n|Internal combustion engines have |thermodynamic limits| on efficiency, expressed as a fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. |Gasoline engines| effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories; |diesel engines| can reach on-board efficiency of 20%; electric vehicles have efficiencies of 69–72%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 59–62%, when counted against required energy to recharge.|[91]|[92]|\n|Electric motors are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. However, they are not equally efficient at all speeds. To allow for this, some cars with dual electric motors have one electric motor with a gear optimised for city speeds and the second electric motor with a gear optimised for highway speeds. The electronics select the motor that has the best efficiency for the current speed and acceleration.|[93]| |Regenerative braking|, which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.|[32]|[91]|\n|\n|Cabin heating and cooling|[|edit|]|\n|While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible |heat pump|, such as on the Nissan Leaf.|[94]| |PTC junction cooling|[95]| is also attractive for its simplicity—this kind of system is used, for example, in the 2008 Tesla Roadster.\n|To avoid using part of the battery\'s energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Renault Zoe and Tesla cars can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.|[96]|[97]|[98]|\n|Some electric cars (for example, the |Citroën Berlingo Electrique|) use an auxiliary heating system (for example |gasoline|-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with |solar power| |external batteries| and USB fans or coolers, or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked; two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.|[99]|\n|\n|Safety|[|edit|]|\n| |Side impact test of a |Tesla Model X|\n|The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard |ISO| 6469. This document is divided into three parts dealing with specific issues:\n|\n|On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery|[100]|\n|Functional safety means and protection against failures|[101]|\n|Protection of persons against electrical hazards|[102]|\n|Heaviness|[|edit|]|\n|The weight of the batteries themselves usually makes an EV heavier than a comparable gasoline vehicle. In a collision, the occupants of a heavy vehicle will, on average, suffer fewer and less serious injuries than the occupants of a lighter vehicle; therefore, the additional weight brings safety benefits (to the occupant).|[103]| On average, an accident will cause about 50% more injuries to the occupants of a 2,000\xa0lb (900\xa0kg) vehicle than those in a 3,000\xa0lb (1,400\xa0kg) vehicle.|[104]| Heavier cars are more dangerous to people outside the car if they hit a pedestrian or another vehicle.|[105]|\n|\n|Stability|[|edit|]|\n|The battery in |skateboard configuration| lowers the center of gravity, increasing driving stability, lowering the risk of an accident through loss of control.|[106]| If there is a separate motor near or in each wheel, this is claimed to be safer due to better handling.|[107]|\n|\n|Risk of fire|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents|\n|Like their ICE counterparts, |electric vehicle batteries| can catch fire after a crash or mechanical failure.|[108]| |Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents| have occurred, albeit fewer per distance traveled than ICE vehicles.|[109]| Some cars\' high-voltage systems are designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment,|[110]|[111]|  and in case of failure firefighters may be trained for manual high-voltage system shutdown.|[112]|[113]| Much more water may be required than for ICE car fires and a |thermal imaging camera| is recommended to warn of possible re-ignition of battery fires.|[114]|[115]|\n|\n|Controls|[|edit|]|\n|As of 2018|[update]|, most electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional |automatic transmission|. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear, and no |parking pawl| may be present, the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case, the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated |hand brake| provides the "P" mode.\n|In some cars, the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic transmission car.|[116]|\n|When an internal combustion vehicle\'s accelerator is released, it may slow by |engine braking|, depending on the type of transmission and mode. EVs are usually equipped with |regenerative braking| that slows the vehicle and recharges the battery somewhat.|[117]| Regenerative braking systems also decrease the use of the conventional brakes (similar to engine braking in an ICE vehicle), reducing brake wear and maintenance costs.\n|\n|Batteries|[|edit|]|\n| |Prototypes of 75 watt-hour/kilogram |lithium-ion polymer batteries|. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 280\xa0W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles.|\n|Main article: |Electric vehicle battery|\n|Lithium-ion-based batteries are often used for their high power and energy density.|[118]| Batteries with different chemical compositions are becoming more widely used, such as |lithium iron phosphate| which is not dependant on nickel and cobalt so can be used to make cheaper batteries and thus cheaper cars.|[119]|\n|\n|Range|[|edit|]|\n|Further information: |List of electric cars currently available|\n|The range of an electric car depends on the number and type of batteries used, and (as with all vehicles), the aerodynamics, weight and type of vehicle, performance requirements, and the weather.|[120]| Cars marketed for mainly city use are often manufactured with a short range battery to keep them small and light.|[121]|\n|Most electric cars are fitted with a display of the expected range. This may take into account how the vehicle is being used and what the battery is powering. However, since factors can vary over the route, the estimate can vary from the actual range. The display allows the driver to make informed choices about driving speed and whether to stop at a charging point en route. Some |roadside assistance| organizations offer charge trucks to recharge electric cars in case of emergency.|[122]|\n|Longest range in 2021 was 800\xa0km|[123]| and several companies aim to reach 1000\xa0km on a single charge in the mid-2020s.|[124]|[125]|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Comparison of |EPA|-rated |range| for |model year| 2020 electric cars rated up until January 2020|[126]|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|NIO ES8| has a swappable battery pack.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Charging|[|edit|]|\n| |BYD e6| is able to recharge to 80% in 15 minutes.|\n|Connectors|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |IEC 62196|\n|Most electric cars use |a wired connection| to supply electricity for recharging. Electric vehicle charging plugs are not universal throughout the world. However vehicles using one type of plug are generally able to charge at other types of charging stations through the use of plug adapters.|[127]|\n|The |Type 2 connector| is the most common type of plug, but different versions are used in China and Europe.|[128]|[129]|\n|The |Type 1 (also called SAE J1772)| connector is common in North America|[130]|[131]| but rare elsewhere, as it does not support |three-phase| charging.|[132]|\n|Wireless charging|, either for stationary cars or as an |electric road|,|[133]| is less common as of 2021|[update]|, but is used in some cities for taxis.|[134]|[135]|\n|\n|Home charging|[|edit|]|\n|Electric cars are usually charged overnight from a |home charging station|;  sometimes known as a charging point, wallbox charger, or simply a charger; in a garage or on the outside of a house.|[136]|[137]| As of 2021|[update]| typical home chargers are 7\xa0kW, but not all include |smart charging|.|[136]| Compared to fossil fuel vehicles, the need for charging using public infrastructure is diminished because of the opportunities for home charging; vehicles can be plugged in and begin each day with a full charge.|[138]| Charging from a standard outlet is also possible but very slow.\n|\n|Public charging|[|edit|]|\n| |Charging station at |Rio de Janeiro|, |Brazil|. This station is run by |Petrobras| and uses |solar energy|.|\n|Main article: |Electric vehicle charging network|\n|Public |charging stations| are almost always faster than home chargers,|[139]| with many |supplying direct current| to avoid the bottleneck of going through the car\'s AC to DC converter,|[140]| as of 2021|[update]| the fastest being 350\xa0kW.|[141]|\n|Combined Charging System| (CCS) is the most widespread charging standard,|[129]| whereas the |GB/T 27930| standard is used in China, and |CHAdeMO| in Japan. The United States has no de facto standard, with a mix of CCS, |Tesla Superchargers|, and CHAdeMO charging stations.\n|Charging an electric vehicle using public charging stations takes longer than refueling a fossil fuel vehicle. The speed at which a vehicle can recharge depends on the charging station\'s charging speed and the vehicle\'s own capacity to receive a charge.  As of 2021|[update]| some cars are 400 volt and some 800 volt.|[142]| Connecting a vehicle that can accommodate very fast charging to a charging station with a very high rate of charge can refill the vehicle\'s battery to 80% in 15 minutes.|[143]| Vehicles and charging stations with slower charging speeds may take as long as two hours to refill a battery to 80%. As with a mobile phone, the final 20% takes longer because the systems slow down to fill the battery safely and avoid damaging it.\n|Some companies are building |battery swapping| stations, to substantially reduce the effective time to recharge.|[144]|[145]| Some electric cars (for example, the |BMW i3|) have an optional gasoline |range extender|. The system is intended as an emergency backup to extend range to the next recharging location, and not for long-distance travel.|[146]|\n|\n|Electric roads|[|edit|]|\n|Electric road technologies which power and charge electric vehicles while driving were |assessed in Sweden| from 2013.|[147]|:\u200a12\u200a| The assessment was scheduled to conclude in 2022.|[148]| The first standard for electrical equipment on-board a vehicle powered by a rail electric road system (ERS), |CENELEC| Technical Standard 50717, has been approved in late 2022.|[149]| Following standards, encompassing "full interoperability" and a "unified and interoperable solution" for ground-level power supply, are scheduled to be published by the end 2024, detailing complete "specifications for communication and power supply through conductive rails embedded in the road".|[150]|[151]| The first permanent electric road in Sweden is planned to be completed by 2026|[152]| on a section of the |E20 route| between |Hallsberg| and |Örebro|, followed by an expansion of further 3000 kilometers of electric roads by 2045.|[153]| A working group of the |French Ministry of Ecology| considers |ground-level power supply| technologies the most likely candidate for electric roads,|[154]| and recommended adopting a European electric road standard formulated with Sweden, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, and others.|[155]| France plans to invest 30 to 40 billion euro by 2035 in an |electric road system| spanning 8,800 kilometers that recharges electric cars, buses and trucks while driving. Two tenders for assessment of electric road technologies are expected to be announced by 2023. |[154]|\n|\n|Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |vehicle-to-grid|\n|During |peak load| periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capabilities could contribute energy to the grid. These vehicles can then be recharged during |off-peak| hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. The batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.|[156]|\n|\n|Lifespan|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Rechargeable battery §\xa0Lifespan and cycle stability|\n|As with all lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicle batteries may degrade over long periods of time, especially if they are frequently charged to 100%; however, this may take at least several years before being noticeable.|[157]| A typical warranty is 8 years or 100,000\xa0mi (160,000\xa0km),|[158]| but they usually last much longer, perhaps 15 to 20 years in the car and then more years in another use.|[159]|\n|\n|Currently available electric cars|[|edit|]|\n|Highway capable|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |List of production battery electric vehicles|\n|Tesla| became the world\'s leading electric vehicle manufacturer in December 2019.|[160]|[161]| Its |Model S| was the world\'s top selling plug-in electric car in 2015 and 2016,|[162]|[163]| and its Model 3 has been the world\'s best selling plug-in electric car for four consecutive years, from 2018 to 2021.|[6]|[164]|[165]|[166]| The |Tesla Model 3| surpassed the Leaf in early 2020 to become the world\'s cumulative best selling electric car.|[10]| Tesla produced its 1\xa0millionth electric car in March 2020, becoming the first auto manufacturer to do so,|[167]| and in June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass 1\xa0million sales.|[11]| Tesla has been listed as the world\'s top selling plug-in electric car manufacturer, both as a |brand| and by |automotive group| for four years running, from 2018 to 2021.|[6]|[168]|[169]|[170]|[164]| At the end of 2021, Tesla\'s global cumulative sales since 2012 totaled 2.3\xa0million units,|[171]| with 936,222 of those delivered in 2021.|[172]|\n|As of December\xa02021|[update]|, the |Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance| is listed as one of the world\'s leading all-electric vehicle manufacturers, with global all-electric vehicle sales totaling over 1\xa0million light-duty electric vehicles, including those manufactured by |Mitsubishi Motors| since 2009.|[173]|[174]| |Nissan| leads global sales within the Alliance, with about 500,000 cars and vans sold by April 2020,|[175]| followed by the |Groupe Renault| with more than 397,000 electric vehicles sold worldwide through December 2020, including its |Twizy| |heavy quadricycle|.|[176]| Mitsubishi\'s only all-electric vehicle is the |i-MiEV|, with global sales of over 50,000 units by March 2015, accounting for all variants of the i-MiEV, including the two minicab versions sold in Japan.|[177]| The Alliance\'s best-selling Nissan Leaf was the world\'s top-selling plug-in electric car in 2013 and 2014.|[162]| Until early 2020, the |Nissan Leaf| was the world\'s all-time top-selling highway-legal electric car,|[10]| and, as of October\xa02021|[update]|, global sales totaled 550,000 units since inception.|[178]|\n|Other leading electric vehicles manufacturers are |BAIC Motor|, with 480,000 units sold, |SAIC Motor| with 314,000 units, and |Geely| with 228,700, all cumulative sales in China as of December\xa02019|[update]|,|[179]| and |Volkswagen|.|[180]|\n|The following table lists the all-time best-selling highway-capable all-electric cars with cumulative global sales of over 200,000 units:\n|\n|\n|All-time top selling highway-capable|(1)| all-electric passenger cars\n|\n|\n|Company\n|\n|Model\n|\n|Market launch\n|\n|Image\n|\n|Annual global sales\n|\n|Total global sales\n|\n|Total sales through\n|\n|Ref|\n|\n|\n| |Tesla, Inc.|\n|Tesla Model 3|\n|2017-07\n|\n|\n|500,713 (2021)|\n|~1.3\xa0million|\n|2021-12|\n|[6]|[181]|\n|\n|\n| |Nissan|\n|Nissan Leaf|\n|2010-12\n|\n|\n|64,201 (2021)|\n|564,201|\n|2021-12|\n|[6]|[182]|\n|\n|\n|SAIC-GM-Wuling|\n|Wuling Hongguang Mini EV|\n|2020-07\n|\n|\n|424,138 (2021)|\n|551,789|(2)|\n|2021-12|\n|[6]|[183]|\n|\n|\n| |Tesla, Inc.|\n|Tesla Model Y|\n|2020-03|\n|\n|410,517 (2021)|\n|~490,000|\n|2021-12|\n|[6]|[184]|\n|\n|\n| |Renault|\n|Renault Zoe|\n|2012-12\n|\n|\n|77,529 (2021)|\n|362,329|\n|2021-12|\n|[176]|[185]|\n|\n|\n| |Tesla, Inc.|\n|Tesla Model S|\n|2012-06\n|\n|\n|~10,900 (3Q 2021)|\n|~319,600|\n|2021-09|\n|[186]|[187]|\n|\n|\n|Chery|\n|Chery eQ|\n|2014-11\n|\n|\n|68,821 (2021)|\n|~243,000|\n|2021-12|\n|[6]|[188]|[189]|\n|\n|\n| |BMW|\n|BMW i3|\n|2013-11\n|\n|\n|28,216 (2021)|\n|~220,000|(3)|\n|2021-12|\n|[190]|[191]|\n|\n|\n|BAIC|\n|BAIC EU-Series|\n|2016-01\n|\n|\n|19,794 (2021)|\n|218,228|(2)|\n|2021-12|\n|[192]|\n|\n|\n|BAIC|\n|BAIC EC-Series|\n|2016-12\n|\n|\n|454 (2021)|\n|206,079|(2)|\n|2021-12|\n|[193]|\n|\n|\n|BYD\n|\n|BYD dolphin\n|\n|2021-08\n|\n|\n|\n|180,461 (2022)\n|\n|210,059\n|\n|2022-12\n|\n|[194]|[195]|\n|\n|\n|Notes:| |(1) Vehicles are considered highway-capable if able to achieve at least a top speed of 100\xa0km/h (62\xa0mph).|(2) Sales in mainland China only.| (3) BMW i3 sales includes the |REx| variant (split is not available). |\n|\n|Electric cars by country|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |electric car use by country|\n|In the year of 2021, the total number of electric cars on the world’s roads went to about 16.5 million.

A vehicle using automation for difficult tasks, especially navigation, to ease but not entirely replace human input, may be referred to as |semi-autonomous|, whereas a vehicle relying solely on automation is called |robotic| or |autonomous|.|[3]| Both of these types are instantiated in today\'s various |self-driving cars|, |unmanned surface vehicles|, |autonomous trains|, advanced airliner |autopilots|, |drone aircraft|, and |planetary rovers|, as well as guided |rockets| and |missiles|. After the invention of the |integrated circuit|, the sophistication of |automation| technology increased. Manufacturers and researchers subsequently added a variety of automated functions to automobiles and other vehicles. The technology involved in implementing autonomous vehicles is very expansive, ranging from technological improvements in the vehicle itself to the environment and objects around the vehicle. As the use of automated vehicles increases, they are becoming more influential in human lives. Although automated vehicles bring various benefits, they also come with various concerns. Also, there are still technological challenges that need to be overcome in order to make vehicular automation robust and scalable.|[4]|\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Overview|\n|2| |Autonomy levels|\n|3| |Technology used in vehicular automation|\n|4| |Success in the technology|\n|\n|4.1| |The SARTRE Project|\n|4.2| |Risks and liabilities|\n|\n|\n|5| |Challenges|\n|\n|5.1| |Technical challenges|\n|5.2| |Societal challenges|\n|5.3| |Regulatory challenges|\n|\n|\n|6| |Ground vehicles|\n|\n|6.1| |Cars|\n|6.2| |Shuttle|\n|\n|6.2.1| |Trials|\n|\n|\n|6.3| |Buses|\n|6.4| |Trucks|\n|\n|6.4.1| |Suppliers|\n|\n|\n|6.5| |Motorcycles|\n|6.6| |Trains|\n|6.7| |Trams|\n|6.8| |Automated guided vehicle|\n|\n|\n|7| |Aircraft|\n|\n|7.1| |Delivery drones|\n|\n|\n|8| |Watercraft|\n|\n|8.1| |Sea Machines|\n|8.2| |Buffalo Automation|\n|8.3| |Autonomous Marine Systems|\n|8.4| |Mayflower|\n|8.5| |Saildrones|\n|8.6| |DARPA|\n|\n|\n|9| |Submersibles|\n|10| |Assistance robots|\n|\n|10.1| |Spot|\n|\n|\n|11| |Highway Code change|\n|12| |Concerns|\n|\n|12.1| |Lack of control|\n|12.2| |Malfunctions|\n|12.3| |Ethical|\n|\n|\n|13| |See also|\n|14| |References|\n|15| |External links|\n|\n|\n|Overview|[|edit|]|\n| |Automated vehicle system technology hierarchy|\n|An automated driving system is generally an integrated package of individual |automated systems| operating in concert. Automated driving implies that the driver has delegated the ability to drive (i.e., all appropriate monitoring, agency, and action functions) to the vehicle automation system. Even though the driver may be alert and ready to take action at any moment, the automation system controls all functions.\n|Automated driving systems are often conditional, meaning that the automation system is capable of automated driving, but not for all conditions encountered in the course of normal operation.  Therefore, a human driver is functionally required to initiate the automated driving system, and may or may not do so when driving conditions are within the capability of the system. When the vehicle automation system has assumed all driving functions, the human is no longer driving the vehicle but continues to assume responsibility for the vehicle\'s performance as the vehicle operator. The automated vehicle operator is not functionally required to actively monitor the vehicle\'s performance while the automation system is engaged, but the operator must be available to resume driving within several seconds of being prompted to do so, as the system has limited conditions of automation. While the automated driving system is engaged, certain conditions may prevent real-time human input, but for no more than a few seconds. The operator is able to resume driving at any time subject to this short delay. When the operator has resumed all driving functions, he or she is the vehicle\'s driver again.\n|[5]| Fully autonomous cars and trucks that drive us instead of us driving them will become a reality. These self-driving vehicles ultimately will integrate onto U.S. roadways by progressing through six levels of driver assistance technology advancements in the coming years. This includes everything from no automation (where a fully engaged driver is required at all times), to full autonomy (where an automated vehicle operates independently, without a human driver).\n|An automated driving system is defined in an proposed amendment to  Article 1 of the |Vienna Convention on Road Traffic|:\n|\n|(ab) "|Automated driving system|" refers to a vehicle system that uses both hardware and\nsoftware to exercise dynamic control of a vehicle on a sustained basis.|(ac) "Dynamic control" refers to carrying out all the real-time operational and tactical functions required to move the vehicle. This includes controlling the vehicle’s lateral and longitudinal motion, monitoring the road environment, responding to events in the road traffic environment, and planning and signalling for manoeuvres.|[6]|\n|This amendment will enter into force on 14 July 2022, unless it is rejected before 13 January 2022.|[7]|\n|\n|An automated driving feature must be described sufficiently clearly so that it is distinguished from an assisted driving feature.|—\u2009|SMMT|[8]|\n|There are two clear states – a vehicle is either assisted with a driver being supported by technology or automated where the technology is effectively and safely replacing the driver.|—\u2009|SMMT|[8]|\n|Autonomy levels|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Self-driving_car §\xa0Classification|\n|Further information: |Automatic train operation §\xa0Types of train automation|\n|Autonomy in vehicles is often categorized in six levels:|[9]| The level system was developed by the |Society of Automotive Engineers| (SAE).|[10]|\n|\n|Level 0: No automation.|\n|Level 1: Driver assistance - The vehicle can control either steering or speed autonomously in specific circumstances to assist the driver.|\n|Level 2: Partial automation - The vehicle can control both steering and speed autonomously in specific circumstances to assist the driver.|\n|Level 3: Conditional automation - The vehicle can control both steering and speed autonomously under normal environmental conditions, but requires driver oversight.|\n|Level 4: High automation - The vehicle can complete travel autonomously under normal environmental conditions, not requiring driver oversight.|\n|Level 5: Full autonomy - The vehicle can complete travel autonomously in any environmental conditions.|\n|Level 0 refers, for instance, to vehicles which do not have |adaptive cruise control|.\n|Level 1 and 2 refer to vehicles where one part of the driving task is performed by the vehicle |advanced driver-assistance systems| (ADAS) under the responsibility/accountability/liability of the driver.\n|From level 3, the driver can conditionally transfer the driving task to the vehicle, but the driver must take back control when the conditional automation is no longer available. For instance an |automated traffic jam pilot| can drive in the |traffic jam| but the driver should take back control when traffic jam is over.\n|Level 5 refers to a vehicle which does not need any (human) driver.\n|"Level 2+" or "semi-automated" is a kind of enhanced level 2 where some manufacturers are ready to provide more features than the basic features of a level 2 system, but manufacturers and regulators are not yet ready for SAE level 3. This led to the introduction of the informal notion of "enhanced level 2" or "level 2+" or "semi-automated" — a dominant ADAS trend in 2021  —  which is a level 2 with additional safety and comfort. For instance, a low cost level 2+ vehicle can include interior-monitoring technologies to ensure driver attention, adaptive merging for when vehicles are entering or exiting the highway, and new kinds of enhanced |automatic emergency braking| (AEB) for pedestrian, cyclist and motorcyclist safety. Level 2+ can also include lane change and overtaking.|[11]|\n|The levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 - no automation; Level 1 - hands on/shared control; Level 2 - hands off; Level 3 - eyes off; Level 4 - mind off, and Level 5 - steering wheel optional.\n|As of December 2021|[update]|, level 3 remains a marginal portion of the market, with only one hundred level 3 |Honda Legend| cars available in the Japanese market.|[11]| It is possible that level 3 remains a marginal portion of the market until 2025.|[11]|\n|\n|Technology used in vehicular automation|[|edit|]|\n|The primary means of implementing autonomous vehicles is through the use of |Artificial Intelligence| (AI). In order for full autonomous vehicles to be implemented, the lower levels of automation must be thoroughly tested and implemented before moving on to the next level.|[12]| Through implementing autonomous systems, such as navigation, collision avoidance and steering, autonomous vehicle manufacturers work towards higher levels of autonomy by designing and implementing different systems of the car.|[12]| These autonomous systems, along with the use of artificial intelligence methods, can use the machine learning aspect of AI in order for the vehicle to control each of the other autonomous systems and processes. Thus, autonomous vehicle manufacturers are researching and developing appropriate AI specifically for autonomous vehicles.|[13]| While many of these companies are continuously developing technologies to be implemented into their autonomous vehicles, the general consensus is that the underlying technology is still in need of further development before fully autonomous vehicles are possible.|[14]|\n|Arguably one of the most important systems of any autonomous vehicle, the perception system must be fully developed and well-tested in order for autonomy to advance.|[14]| With the development and implementation of the perception system on autonomous vehicles, much of the safety standards of autonomous vehicles are being addressed by this system, which places an unequivocal emphasis on it to be flawless, as human lives would be subject to harm if a faulty system were to be developed.|[14]| The main purpose for the perception system is to constantly scan the surrounding environment and determine which objects in the environment pose a threat to vehicles.|[14]| In a sense, the perception system\'s main goal is to act like human perception, allowing the system to sense hazards and to prepare or correct for these hazards.|[14]| In terms of the detection part of the perception system, many solutions are being tested for accuracy and compatibility, such as |radar|, |lidar|, |sonar| and moving image processing.|[14]|\n|With the development of these autonomous subsystems of the car, autonomous vehicle manufacturers have already developed systems which act as assistance features on a vehicle. These systems are known as |advanced driver-assistance systems|, and contain systems to do such actions as parallel parking and emergency braking.|[13]| Along these systems, autonomous navigation systems play a role in the development of autonomous vehicles. In implementing the navigation system, there are two ways in which navigation can be implemented: sensing from one vehicle to another or sensing from the infrastructure.|[13]| These navigation systems would work in tandem with already well established navigation systems, such as the |Global Positioning System| (GPS), and be able to process route information, detecting such things as traffic jams, tolls and or road construction. From this information, the vehicle can then take the appropriate action to either avoid the area or plan accordingly.|[14]| However, there may be problems in using this method, such as outdated information, in which case vehicle to infrastructure communication can play a large role in constantly having up-to-date information.|[14]| An instance of this is having street signs and other regulatory markers display information to the vehicle, which allows the vehicle to make decisions based on the current information.|[14]|\n|Along with the development of autonomous vehicles, many of these vehicles are expected to be primarily electric, meaning that the main power source of the vehicle will be electric-based rather than fossil fuel-based.|[12]| Along with that, there comes the extra demand on autonomous vehicle manufacturers to produce higher quality electric cars in order to implement all the autonomous systems associated with the vehicle.|[15]| However, much of modern-day vehicle components can still be used in autonomous vehicles, such as the use of the automatic transmissions and operator protection equipment like airbags.|[15]|\n|In consideration of the development of autonomous vehicles, companies also are considering operator preferences and needs. These instances include allowing the user to minimize time, follow a precise route and accommodate any possible disabilities that the operator may have.|[16]| Along with accommodating the driver, autonomous vehicles also impose a technological factor onto the environment around it, generally needing a higher sense of connectivity in the vehicle\'s environment. With this new factor to consider, many urban governments are considering becoming a |smart city| in order to provide a sufficient foundation for autonomous vehicles.|[16]| Along these same lines of the vehicle\'s environment accommodating the vehicle, the user of these vehicles may also have to be technologically connected in order to operate these autonomous vehicles. With the advent of smartphones, it is predicted that autonomous vehicles will be able to have this connection with the user\'s smartphone or other technological devices similar to a smartphone.|[16]|\n|\n|Success in the technology|[|edit|]|\n|AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety| conducted a test of two automatic emergency braking systems: those designed to prevent crashes and others that aim to make a crash less severe. The test looked at popular models like the 2016 Volvo XC90, Subaru Legacy, Lincoln MKX, Honda Civic and Volkswagen Passat. Researchers tested how well each system stopped when approaching both a moving and nonmoving target. It found that systems capable of preventing crashes reduced vehicle speeds by twice that of the systems designed to merely mitigate crash severity. When the two test vehicles traveled within 30\xa0mph of each other, even those designed to simply lessen crash severity avoided crashes 60 percent of the time.|[17]|\n|The success in the automated driving system has been known to be successful in situations like rural road settings. Rural road settings would be a setting in which there is lower amounts of traffic and lower differentiation between driving abilities and types of drivers. "The greatest challenge in the development of automated functions is still inner-city traffic, where an extremely wide range of road users must be considered from all directions."|[18]| This technology is progressing to a more reliable way of the automated driving cars to switch from auto-mode to driver mode. |Auto-mode| is the mode that is set in order for the automated actions to take over, while the driver mode is the mode set in order to have the operator controlling all functions of the car and taking the responsibilities of operating the vehicle (Automated driving system not engaged).\n|This definition would include vehicle automation systems that may be available in the near term—such as traffic-jam assist, or full-range automated cruise control—if such systems would be designed such that the human operator can reasonably divert attention (monitoring) away from the performance of the vehicle while the automation system is engaged. This definition would also include automated platooning (such as conceptualized by the SARTRE project).\n|\n|The SARTRE Project|[|edit|]|\n|The |SARTRE| project\'s main goal is to create platooning, a train of automated cars, that will provide comfort and have the ability for the driver of the vehicle to arrive safely to a destination. Along with the ability to be along the train, drivers that are driving past these platoons, can join in with a simple activation of the automated driving system that correlates with a truck that leads the platoon. The |SARTRE| project is taking what we know as a train system and mixing it with automated driving technology. This is intended to allow for an easier transportation through cities and ultimately help with traffic flow through heavy automobile traffic.\n|In some parts of the world the self-driving car has been tested in real life situations such as in Pittsburgh.|[19]| |The Self-driving Uber| has been put to the test around the city, driving with different types of drivers as well as different traffic situations. Not only have there been testing and successful parts to the automated car, but there has also been extensive testing in California on automated busses. The lateral control of the automated buses uses magnetic markers such as the platoon at San Diego, while the longitudinal control of the automated truck platoon uses millimeter wave radio and radar. Current examples around today\'s society include the |Google car| and |Tesla|\'s models. |Tesla| has redesigned automated driving, they have created car models that allow drivers to put in the destination and let the car take over.  These are two modern day examples of the automated driving system cars.\n|\n|Risks and liabilities|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Computer security §\xa0Automobiles|, and |Autonomous car liability|\n|Many automakers such as |Ford| and |Volvo| have announced plans to offer fully automated cars in the future.|[20]| Extensive research and development is being put into automated driving systems, but the biggest problem automakers cannot control is how drivers will use system.|[20]| Drivers are stressed to stay attentive and safety warnings are implemented to alert the driver when corrective action is needed.|[21]| |Tesla Motor|\'s has one recorded incident that resulted in a fatality involving the automated driving system in the Tesla Model S.|[22]| The accident report reveals the accident was a result of the driver being inattentive and the autopilot system not recognizing the obstruction ahead.|[22]|\n|Another flaw with automated driving systems is that in situations where unpredictable events such as weather or the driving behavior of others may cause fatal accidents due to sensors that monitor the surroundings of the vehicle not being able to provide corrective action.|[21]|\n|To overcome some of the challenges for automated driving systems, novel methodologies based on virtual testing, traffic flow simulation and digital prototypes have been proposed,|[23]| especially when novel algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence approaches are employed which require extensive training and validation data sets.\n|The implementation of automated driving systems poses the possibility of changing build environments in urban areas, such as the expansion of suburban areas due to the increased ease of mobility.|[12]|\n|\n|Challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Around 2015, several self-driving car companies including Nissan and Toyota promised self-driving cars by 2020. However, the predictions turned out to be far too optimistic.|[24]|\n|There are still many obstacles in developing fully autonomous Level 5 vehicles, which is able to operate in any conditions. Currently, companies are focused on Level 4 automation, which is able to operate under certain environmental circumstances.|[24]|\n|There is still debate about what an autonomous vehicle should look like. For example, whether to incorporate lidar to autonomous driving systems is still being argued. Some researchers have come up with algorithms utilizing camera-only data that achieve the performance that rival those of lidar. On the other hand, camera-only data sometimes draw inaccurate bounding boxes, and thus lead to poor predictions. This is due to the nature of superficial information that |stereo cameras| provide, whereas incorporating lidar gives autonomous vehicles precise distance to each point on the vehicle.|[24]|\n|\n|Technical challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Software Integration: Because of the large number of sensors and safety processes required by autonomous vehicles, software integration remains a challenging task. A robust autonomous vehicle should ensure that the integration of hardware and software can recover from component failures.|[25]|\n|Prediction and trust among autonomous vehicles: Fully autonomous cars should be able to anticipate the actions of other cars like humans do. Human drivers are great at predicting other drivers\' behaviors, even with a small amount of data such as eye contact or hand gestures. In the first place, the cars should agree on traffic rules, whose turn it is to drive in an intersection, and so on. This scales into a larger issue when there exists both human-operated cars and self-driving cars due to more uncertainties. A robust autonomous vehicle is expected to improve on understanding the environment better to address this issue.|[25]|\n|Scaling up: The coverage of autonomous vehicles testing could not be accurate enough. In cases where heavy traffic and obstruction exist, it requires faster response time or better tracking algorithms from the autonomous vehicles. In cases where unseen objects are encountered, it\'s important that the algorithms are able to track these objects and avoid collisions.|[25]|\n|Societal challenges|[|edit|]|\n|One critical step to achieve the implementation of autonomous vehicles is the acceptance by the general public. It is an important ongoing research because it provides guidelines for the automobile industry to improve their design and technology. Studies have shown that many people believe that using autonomous vehicles is safer, which underlines the necessity for the automobile companies to assure that autonomous vehicles improve safety benefits. The TAM research model breaks down important factors that affect the consumer\'s acceptance into: usefulness, ease to use, trust, and social influence.|[26]|\n|\n|The usefulness factor studies whether or not autonomous vehicles are useful in that they provide benefits that save consumers\' time and make their lives simpler. How well the consumers believe autonomous vehicles will be useful compared to other forms of transportation solutions is a determining factor.|[26]|\n|The ease to use factor studies the user-friendliness of the autonomous vehicles. While the notion that consumers care more about ease to use than safety has been challenged, it still remains an important factor that has indirect effects on the public\'s intention to use autonomous vehicles.|[26]|\n|The trust factor studies the safety, data privacy and security protection of autonomous vehicles. A more trusted system has a positive impact on the consumer\'s decision to use autonomous vehicles.|[26]|\n|The social influence factor studies whether the influence of others would influence consumer\'s likelihood of having autonomous vehicles. Studies have shown that the social influence factor is positively related to behavioral intention. This might be due to the fact that cars traditionally serve as a status symbol that represents one\'s intent to use and his social environment.|[26]|\n|Regulatory challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Real-time testing of autonomous vehicles is an inevitable part of the process.\xa0At the same time, vehicular automation regulators are faced with challenges to protect public safety and yet allow autonomous vehicle companies to test their products. Groups representing autonomous vehicle companies are resisting most regulations, whereas groups representing vulnerable road users and traffic safety are pushing for regulatory barriers. To improve traffic safety, the regulators are encouraged to find a middle ground that protects the public from immature technology while allowing autonomous vehicle companies to test the implementation of their systems.|[27]| There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety regulatory knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics.|[28]|\n|\n|Ground vehicles|[|edit|]|\n|Further information: |Unmanned ground vehicle|\n|Ground vehicles employing automation and |teleoperation| include shipyard gantries, mining trucks, bomb-disposal robots, robotic insects, and |driverless tractors|.\n|There are a lot of autonomous and semi-autonomous ground vehicles being made for the purpose of transporting passengers. One such example is the free-ranging on grid (|FROG|) technology which consists of autonomous vehicles, a magnetic track and a supervisory system. The FROG system is deployed for industrial purposes in factory sites and has been in use since 1999 on the |ParkShuttle|, a |PRT|-style public transport system in the city of |Capelle aan den IJssel| to connect the Rivium business park with the neighboring city of |Rotterdam| (where the route terminates at the |Kralingse Zoom| metro station). The system experienced a crash in 2005|[29]| that proved to be caused by a human error.|[30]|\n|Applications for automation in ground vehicles include the following:\n|\n|Vehicle tracking system| system ESITrack, |Lojack|\n|Rear-view alarm, to detect obstacles behind.|\n|Anti-lock braking system| (ABS) (also Emergency Braking Assistance (|EBA|)), often coupled with |Electronic brake force distribution| (EBD), which prevents the brakes from locking and losing traction while braking. This shortens stopping distances in most cases and, more importantly, allows the driver to steer the vehicle while braking.|\n|Traction control system| (TCS) actuates brakes or reduces throttle to restore traction if driven wheels begin to spin.|\n|Four wheel drive| (AWD) with a centre differential. Distributing power to all four wheels lessens the chances of wheel spin. It also suffers less from |oversteer| and |understeer|.|\n|Electronic Stability Control| (ESC) (also known for |Mercedes-Benz| proprietary Electronic Stability Program (ESP), |Acceleration Slip Regulation| (ASR) and Electronic differential lock (EDL)). Uses various sensors to intervene when the car senses a possible loss of control. The car\'s control unit can reduce power from the engine and even apply the brakes on individual wheels to prevent the car from |understeering| or |oversteering|.|\n|Dynamic steering response| (DSR) corrects the rate of |power steering| system to adapt it to vehicle\'s speed and road conditions.|\n|Research is ongoing and prototypes of autonomous ground vehicles exist.\n|\n|Cars|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Self-driving car|\n|Extensive automation for cars focuses on either introducing |robotic cars| or modifying modern car designs to be semi-autonomous.\n|Semi-autonomous designs could be implemented sooner as they rely less on technology that is still at the forefront of research. An example is the dual mode monorail. Groups such as |RUF| (Denmark) and TriTrack (USA) are working on projects consisting of specialized private cars that are driven manually on normal roads but also that dock onto a monorail/guideway along which they are driven autonomously.\n|As a method of automating cars without extensively modifying the cars as much as a |robotic car|, |Automated highway systems| (AHS) aims to construct lanes on highways that would be equipped with, for example, magnets to guide the vehicles. Automation vehicles have auto-brakes named as Auto Vehicles Braking System (AVBS). Highway computers would manage the traffic and direct the cars to avoid crashes.\n|In 2006, The |European Commission| has established a smart car development program called the |Intelligent Car Flagship Initiative|.|[31]|  The goals of that program include:\n|\n|Adaptive cruise control|\n|Lane departure warning system|\n|Project AWAKE for drowsy drivers|\n|There are plenty of further uses for automation in relation to cars. These include:\n|\n|Assured Clear Distance Ahead|\n|Adaptive headlamps|\n|Advanced Automatic Collision Notification|, such as |OnStar|\n|Intelligent Parking Assist System|\n|Automatic Parking|\n|Automotive night vision| with pedestrian detection|\n|Blind spot monitoring|\n|Driver Monitoring System|\n|Robotic car| or self-driving car which may result in less-stressed "drivers", higher efficiency (the driver can do something else), increased safety and less |pollution| (e.g. via completely automated |fuel| control)|\n|Precrash system|\n|Safe speed governing|\n|Traffic sign recognition|\n|Following another car on a motorway – "enhanced" or "adaptive" cruise control, as used by Ford and Vauxhall|[32]|\n|Distance control assist – as developed by Nissan|[33]|\n|Dead man\'s switch| – there is a move to introduce |deadman\'s braking| into automotive application, primarily heavy vehicles, and there may also be a need to add |penalty switches| to |cruise controls|.|\n|Singapore also announced a set of provisional national standards on January 31, 2019, to guide the autonomous vehicle industry. The standards, known as Technical Reference 68 (TR68), will promote the safe deployment of fully driverless vehicles in Singapore, according to a joint press release by Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Land Transport Authority (LTA), Standards Development Organisation and Singapore Standards Council (SSC).|[34]|\n|\n|Shuttle|[|edit|]|\n| |Parkshuttle|\n| |Navya Autonom Shuttle|\n| |Easymile EZ10|\n|Since 1999, the 12-seat/10-standing |ParkShuttle| has been operating on an 1.8 kilometres (1.1\xa0mi) exclusive right of way in the city of |Capelle aan den IJssel| in The Netherlands. The system uses small magnets in the road surface to allow the vehicle to determine its position.  The use of shared autonomous vehicles was trialed around 2012 in a hospital car park in Portugal.|[35]|  From 2012 to 2016 the |European Union| funded CityMobil2 project examined the use of shared autonomous vehicles and passenger experience including short term trials in seven cities. This project led to the development of the EasyMile EZ10.|[36]|\n|In the 2010s, self-driving shuttle became able to run in mixed traffic without the need for embedded guidance markers.|[37]|  So far the focus has been on low speed, 20 miles per hour (32\xa0km/h), with short, fixed routes for the "last mile" of journeys.  This means issues of collision avoidance and safety are significantly less challenging than those for automated cars, which seek to match the performance of conventional vehicles.  Many trials have been undertaken, mainly on quiet roads with little traffic or on public pathways or private roadways and specialised test sites.|[|citation needed|]|  The capacity of different models varies significantly, between 6-seats and 20-seats.  (Above this size there are conventional buses that have driverless technology installed.)\n|In December 2016, the |Jacksonville Transportation Authority| has announced its intention to replace the |Jacksonville Skyway| monorail with driverless vehicles that would run on the existing elevated superstructure as well as continue onto ordinary roads.|[38]|  The project has since been named the "Ultimate Urban Circulator" or "U2C" and testing has been carried out on shuttles from six different manufacturers.  The cost of the project is estimated at $379 million.|[39]|\n|In January 2017, it was announced the |ParkShuttle| system in the Netherlands will be renewed and expanded including extending the route network beyond the exclusive right of way so vehicles will run in mixed traffic on ordinary roads.|[40]|  The plans were delayed and the extension into mixed traffic is now expected in 2021.|[41]|\n|In July 2018, |Baidu| stated it had built 100 of its 8-seat |Apolong| model, with plans for commercial sales.|[42]| As of July 2021 they have not gone into volume production.\n|In August 2020, it was reported there were 25 autonomous shuttle manufacturers,|[43]| including the |2GetThere|, |Local Motors|, |Navya|, |Baidu|, |Easymile|, |Toyota| and Ohmio.\n|In December 2020, |Toyota| showcased it\'s 20-passenger "e-Palette" vehicle, which is due to be used at the |2021 Tokyo Olympic Games|.|[44]|  Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.|[45]|\n|In January 2021, Navya released an investor report which predicted global autonomous shuttle sales will reach 12,600 units by 2025, with a market value of EUR 1.7 billion.|[46]|\n|In June 2021, Chinese maker |Yutong| claimed to have delivered 100 models of its 10-seat Xiaoyu 2.0 autonomous bus for use in |Zhengzhou|.

The purpose of the trials has been to both provide technical data and to familiarize the public with the driverless technology. A 2021 survey of over 100 shuttle experiments across Europe concluded that low speed - 15–20 kilometres per hour (9.3–12.4\xa0mph) - was the major the barrier to implementation of autonomous shuttle buses.  The current cost of the vehicles at €280,000 and the need for onboard attendants were also issues.|[49]|\n|\n|This list is |incomplete|; you can help by |adding missing items|.  |(|November 2021|)|\n|\n|\n|Company/Location|\n|Details\n|\n|\n|Navya| "Arma" in |Neuhausen am Rheinfall|\n|\n|In October 2016, BestMile started trials  in |Neuhausen am Rheinfall|, claiming to be the world\'s first solution for managing hybrid fleets with both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles.|[50]| And the test ended in October 2021.|[51]|\n|\n|\n|Local Motors "Olli"|\n|\n|At the end of 2016, the Olli was tested in |Washington D.C.|[52]|  In 2020, a four month trial was undertaken at the United Nations |ITCILO| campus in |Turin, Italy| to provide transport shuttle to employees and guests within the campus.|[53]|\n|\n|\n|Navya "Autonom"|\n|Navya claimed in May 2017 to have carried almost 150,000 passengers across Europe|[54]| with trials in |Sion|, |Cologne|, |Doha|, |Bordeaux| and the nuclear power plant at |Civaux| as well as |Las Vegas|[55]| and |Perth|.|[56]|  Ongoing public trials are underway in |Lyon|, |Val Thorens| and |Masdar City|.

With developments in self-driving trucks progressing, U.S. self-driving truck sales is expected to reach 60,000 by 2035 according to a report released by |IHS Inc.| in June 2016.|[109]|\n|As reported in June 1995 in |Popular Science Magazine|, self-driving trucks were being developed for combat convoys, whereby only the lead truck would be driven by a human and the following trucks would rely on satellite, an |inertial guidance| system and ground-speed sensors.|[110]| |Caterpillar Inc.| made early developments in 2013 with the |Robotics Institute| at |Carnegie Mellon University| to improve efficiency and reduce cost at various mining and construction sites.|[111]|\n|In Europe, the |Safe Road Trains for the Environment| is such an approach.\n|From PWC\'s Strategy& Report,|[112]| self driving trucks will be the source of a lot of concern around how this technology will impact around 3 million truck drivers in the US, as well as 4 million employees in support of the trucking economy in gas stations, restaurants, bars and hotels. At the same time, some companies like Starsky, are aiming for Level 3 Autonomy, which would see the driver playing a control role around the truck\'s environment. The company\'s project, remote truck driving, would give truck drivers a greater work-life balance, enabling them to avoid long periods away from their home. This would however provoke a potential mismatch between the driver\'s skills with the technological redefinition of the job.\n|Companies that buy driverless trucks could massively cut down on costs: human drivers will no longer be required, companies\' liabilities due to truck accidents will diminish, and productivity will increase (as the driverless truck doesn\'t need to rest). The usage of self driving trucks will go hand in hand with the use of real-time data to optimize both efficiency and productivity of the service delivered, as a way to tackle traffic congestion for example. Driverless trucks could enable new business models that would see deliveries shift from day time to night time or time slots in which traffic is less heavily dense.\n|\n|Suppliers|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|Company|\n|Details\n|\n|\n|Waymo Semi|\n|In March 2018, |Waymo|, the automated vehicle company spun off from |Google| parent company |Alphabet Inc.|, announced it was applying its technology to semi trucks. In the announcement, Waymo noted it would be using automated trucks to move freight related to Google\'s data centers in the |Atlanta|, GA area. The trucks will be manned and operated on public roads.|[113]|\n|\n|\n|Uber Semi|\n|In October 2016, |Uber| completed the first driverless operation of an automated truck on public roads, delivering a trailer of |Budweiser| beer from Fort Collins, CO to Colorado Springs.|[114]| The run was completed at night on Interstate 25 after extensive testing and system improvements in cooperation with the Colorado State Police. The truck had a human in the cab but not sitting in the driver\'s seat, while the Colorado State Police provided a rolling closure of the highway.|[115]| At the time, Uber\'s automated truck was based primarily on technology developed by |Otto|, which Uber acquired in August 2016.|[116]| In March 2018, Uber announced it was using its automated trucks to deliver freight in Arizona, while also leveraging the UberFreight app to find and dispatch loads.|[117]|\n|\n|\n|Embark Semi|\n|\n|In February 2018, Embark Trucks announced it had completed the first cross-country trip of an automated semi, driving 2,400 miles from Los Angeles, CA to Jacksonville, FL on Interstate 10.|[118]| This followed a November 2017 announcement that it had partnered with |Electrolux| and |Ryder| to test its automated truck by moving |Frigidaire| refrigerators from El Paso, TX to Palm Springs, CA.|[119]|\n|\n|\n|\n|Tesla Semi|\n|\n|In November 2017 |Tesla, Inc.|, owned by |Elon Musk|, revealed a prototype of the |Tesla Semi| and announced that it would go into production.

Due to the weight of motorcycles, it is often a challenge for motorcycle owners to keep balance of their vehicles at low speeds or at a stop. Honda\'s motorcycle concept has a self-balancing feature that will keep the vehicle upright. It automatically lowers the center of balance by extending the wheelbase. It then takes control of the steering to keep the vehicle balanced. This allows users to navigate the vehicle more easily when walking or driving in stop and go traffic. However, this system is not for high speed driving.\xa0|[122]|[125]|\n|\n|\n|BMWs Motorrad Vision concept motorcycle|\n|BMW Motorrad developed the ConnectRide self driving motorcycle in order to push the boundaries of motorcycle safety. The autonomous features of the motorcycle include emergency braking, negotiating intersections, assisting during tight turns, and front impact avoidance. These are features similar to current technologies that are being developed and implemented in autonomous cars. This motorcycle can also fully drive on its own at normal driving speed, making turns and returning to a designated location. It lacks the self standing feature that Honda has implemented.|[126]|\n|\n|\n|Yamaha’s riderless motorcycle|\n|“Motoroid” can hold its balance, autonomous driving, recognizing riders and going to a designated location with a hand gesture. Yamaha utilized the “Human beings react a hell of a lot quicker” research philosophy into the motoroid. The idea is that the autonomous vehicle is not attempting to replace human beings, but to augment the abilities of the human with advanced technology. They have tactile feedback such as a gentle squeeze to a rider\'s lower back as a reassuring caress at dangerous speeds, as if the vehicle was responding and communicating with the rider. Their goal is to “meld” the machine and human together to form one experience.|[127]|\n|\n|\n|Harley-Davidson|\n|While their motorcycles are popular, one of the largest problems of owning a Harley-Davidson is the reliability of the vehicle. It is difficult to manage the weight of the vehicle at low speeds and picking it up from the ground can be a difficult process even with correct techniques. In order to attract more customers, they filed a patent for having a gyroscope at the back of the vehicle that will keep the balance of the motorcycle for the rider at low speeds. After 3 miles per hour, the system disengages. However anything below that, the gyroscope can handle the balance of the vehicle which means it can balance even at a stop. This system can be removed if the rider feels ready without it (meaning it is modular).|[125]|\n|\n|Trains|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Automatic train operation|\n|The concept for autonomous vehicles has also been applied for commercial uses, like for autonomous trains. The world\'s first driverless urban transit system is the |Port Island Line| in |Kobe|, Japan, opened in 1981.|[128]| The first self-driving train in the UK was launched in London on the Thameslink route.|[129]|\n|An example of an automated train network is the |Docklands Light Railway| in |London|.\n|Also see |List of automated train systems|.\n|\n|Trams|[|edit|]|\n|In 2018 the first autonomous |trams in Potsdam| were trialed.|[130]|\n|\n|Automated guided vehicle|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Automated guided vehicle|\n|An automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle (AGV) is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision, magnets, or lasers for navigation. They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or warehouse. Application of the automatic guided vehicle has broadened during the late 20th century.\n|\n|Aircraft|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Unmanned aerial vehicle|\n|Aircraft has received much attention for automation, especially for navigation. A system capable of autonomously navigating a vehicle (especially aircraft) is known as |autopilot|.\n|\n|Delivery drones|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Delivery drone|\n|Various industries such as packages and food experimented with delivery drones. Traditional and new transportation companies are competing in the market. For example, |UPS Flight Forward|, Alphabet Wing, and |Amazon Prime Air| are all developing delivery drones.|[131]| |Zipline|, an American medical drone delivery company, has the largest active drone delivery operations in the world, and its drones are capable of Level 4 autonomy.|[132]|\n|However, even if technology seems to allow for those solutions to function correctly as various tests of various companies show, the main throwback to the market launch and use of such drones is inevitably the legislation in place and regulatory agencies have to decide on the framework they wish to take to draft regulation. This process is in different phases across the world as each country will tackle the topic independently. For example, Iceland\'s government and departments of transport, aviation, police have already started issuing licenses for drone operations. It has a permissive approach and together with Costa Rica, Italy, the UAE, Sweden and Norway, has a fairly unrestricted legislation on commercial drone use. Those countries are characterized by a body of regulation that may give operational guidelines or require licensing, registration and insurance.|[133]|\n|On the other side, other countries have decided to ban, either directly (outright ban) or indirectly (effective ban), the use of commercial drones. The RAND Corporation thus makes the difference between countries forbidding drones and those that  have a formal process for commercial drone licensing, but requirements are either impossible to meet or licenses do not appear to have been approved. In the US, UPS is the only one with the Part 135 Standard certification that is required to use drones to deliver to real customers.|[131]|\n|However, most countries seem to be struggling on the integration of drones for commercial uses into their aviation regulatory frameworks. Thus, constraints are placed on the use of those drones such as that they must be operating within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the pilot and thus limiting their potential range. This would be the case of the Netherlands and Belgium. Most countries do let pilot operate outside the VLOS but is subject to restrictions and pilot ratings, which would be the case of the US.\n|The general trend is that legislation is moving fast and laws are constantly being reevaluated. Countries are moving towards a more permissive approach but the industry still lacks infrastructures to ensure the success of such a transition. To provide safety and efficiency, specialized training courses, pilot exams (type of UAV and flying conditions) as well as liability management measures regarding insurances have to be developed.\n|There is a sense of urgency that breathes from this innovation as competition is high and companies lobby to integrate them rapidly in their products and services offerings. Since June 2017, the US Senate legislation reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation to create a carrier certificate allowing for package deliveries by drones.|[134]|\n|\n|Watercraft|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Unmanned surface vehicle|\n|Autonomous boats can provide security, do research, or perform hazardous or repetitive tasks (such as guiding a large ship into a harbor or transporting cargo).\n|\n|Sea Machines|[|edit|]|\n|Sea Machines offers an autonomous system for workboats. While it does require a human operator to oversee its actions, the system takes care of a lot of active domain perception and navigation duties that normally a few members of the crew would have to do. They use AI to have situational awareness for different ships within the route. They utilize camera, lidar, and proprietary software to inform the operator of its status.|[135]|[136]|\n|\n|Buffalo Automation|[|edit|]|\n|Buffalo Automation|, a team formed from the University of Buffalo, creates technology for semi-autonomous features for boats. They started out creating navigation assist technologies for freighters called AutoMate, which is like having another very experienced “first mate” that will look out for the ship.|[137]| The system helps make twists and turns of difficult waterways.|[136]|[138]|\n|\n|Autonomous Marine Systems|[|edit|]|\n|This Massachusetts based company has led the forefront of unmanned sailing drones. The Datamarans are out autonomously sailing around to collect ocean data. They are created to enable large payload packages. Due to the automated system and their solar panels, they are able to navigate for longer periods of time. More than anything they boast their technologies on advanced metocean surveys which collect “wind velocity profiles with altitude, water current, conductivity, temperature profiles with depth, hi-resolution bathymetry, sub-bottom profiling, magnetometer measurements” |[139]|[136]|\n|\n|Mayflower|[|edit|]|\n|The autonomous vessel called Mayflower is expected to be the first large ship that makes an unmanned transatlantic journey.|[140]|\n|\n|Saildrones|[|edit|]|\n|This autonomous unmanned vessel uses both solar and wind energy to navigate.|[141]|\n|\n|DARPA|[|edit|]|\n|Sea Hunter| is an |autonomous| |unmanned surface vehicle| (USV) launched in 2016 as part of the |DARPA| |Anti-Submarine Warfare| Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (|ACTUV|) program.\n|\n|Submersibles|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Autonomous underwater vehicle|\n|Underwater vehicles have been a focus for automation for tasks such as pipeline inspection and underwater mapping.\n|\n|Assistance robots|[|edit|]|\n|Spot|[|edit|]|\n|This robot is a four-legged nimble robot that was created to be able to navigate through many different terrain outdoors and indoors. It can walk on its own without colliding into anything. It utilizes many different sensors, including 360 vision cameras and gyroscopes. It is able to keep its balance even when pushed over. This vehicle, while it is not intended to be ridden, can carry heavy loads for construction workers or military personnel through rough terrain.|[142]|\n|\n|Highway Code change|[|edit|]|\n|The UK considers the way to update its british Highway Code for automated code:\n|\n|Automated vehicles can perform all the tasks involved in driving, in at least some situations. They differ from vehicles fitted with assisted driving features (like |cruise control| and |lane-keeping assistance|), which carry out some tasks, but where the driver is still responsible for driving. If you are driving a vehicle with assisted driving features, you MUST stay in control of the vehicle.|—\u2009|proposed changes to The Highway Code|[143]|\n|If the vehicle is designed to require you to resume driving after being prompted to, while the vehicle is driving itself, you MUST remain in a position to be able to take control. For example, you should not move out of the driving seat. You should not be so distracted that you cannot take back control when prompted by the vehicle.|—\u2009|proposed changes to The Highway Code|[143]|\n|Concerns|[|edit|]|\n|Lack of control|[|edit|]|\n|Through the autonomy level, it is shown that the higher the level of autonomy, the fewer control humans have on their vehicles (highest level of autonomy needing zero human interventions). One of the few concerns regarding the development of vehicular automation is related to the end-users’ trust in the technology that controls automated vehicles.|[144]| According to a nationally conducted survey made by |Kelley Blue Book| (KBB) in 2016, it is shown that the majority of people would still choose to have a certain level of control behind their own vehicle rather than having the vehicle operate in Level 5 autonomy, or in other words, completely autonomous.|[145]| According to half of the respondents, the idea of safety in an autonomous vehicle diminishes as the level of autonomy increases.|[145]| This distrust of autonomous driving systems proved to be unchanged throughout the years when a nationwide survey conducted by |AAA Foundation for Traffic and Safety| (AAAFTS) in 2019 showed the same outcome as the survey KBB did in 2016. AAAFTS survey showed that even though people have a certain level of trust in automated vehicles, most people also have doubts and distrust towards the technology used in autonomous vehicles, with most distrust in Level 5 autonomous vehicles.|[146]| It is shown by AAAFTS’ survey that people\'s trust in autonomous driving systems increased when their level of understanding increased.|[146]|\n|\n|Malfunctions|[|edit|]|\n| |A prototype of an autonomous Uber car being tested in San Francisco|\n|\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The possibility of autonomous vehicle\'s technology to experience malfunctions is also one of the causes of user\'s distrust in autonomous driving systems.|[144]| In fact, it is the concern that most respondents voted for in the AAAFTS survey.|[146]| Even though autonomous vehicles are made to improve traffic safety by minimizing crashes and their severity,|[146]| they still caused fatalities. At least 113 autonomous vehicle related accidents have occurred until 2018.|[147]| In 2015, Google declared that their automated vehicles experienced at least 272 failures, and drivers had to intervene around 13 times to prevent fatalities.|[148]| Furthermore, other automated vehicles’ manufacturers also reported automated vehicles’ failures, including the Uber car incident.|[148]| The self-driving Uber car accident that happened in 2018 is one of the examples of autonomous vehicle accidents that are also listed in List of self-driving car fatalities.\xa0 One of the reports made by the |National Transportation Safety Board| (NTSB) showed that the self-driving Uber car was unable to identify the victim in a sufficient amount of time for the vehicle to slow down and avoid crashing into the victim.|[149]|\n|\n|Ethical|[|edit|]|\n|Another concern related to vehicle automation is its ethical issues. In reality, autonomous vehicles can encounter inevitable traffic accidents. In situations like that, many risks and calculations need to be made in order to minimize the amount of damage the accident could cause.|[150]| When a human driver encounters an inevitable accident, the driver will take a spontaneous action based on ethical and moral logic. However, when a driver has no control over the vehicle (Level 5 autonomy), the system of an autonomous vehicle is the one who needs to make that instant decision.|[150]| Unlike humans, autonomous vehicles don\'t have reflexes and it can only make decisions based on what it is programmed to do.|[150]| However, the situation and circumstances of accidents differ from one another, and one decision might not be the best decision for certain accidents. Based on two research studies in 2019,|[151]|[152]| the implementation of fully automated vehicles in traffic where semi-automated and non-automated vehicles are still present might lead to many complications.|[151]| Some flaws that still need consideration include the structure of liability, distribution of responsibilities,|[152]| efficiency in decision making, and the performance of autonomous vehicles with its diverse surroundings.|[151]| Still, researchers |Steven Umbrello| and |Roman V. Yampolskiy| propose that the |value sensitive design| approach is one method that can be used to design autonomous vehicles to avoid some of these ethical issues and design for human values.|[153]|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Self-driving car|\n|Self-driving truck|\n|Dashcam|\n|Intelligent speed adaptation|\n|Intelligent Transportation System|\n|PReVENT|\n|Robo-Taxi|\n|Transit media|\n|Uncrewed vehicle|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |"Self-steering Mars Rover tested at ESO\'s Paranal Observatory"|. |ESO Announcement|.

Typically |lithium-ion batteries|, they are specifically designed for high |electric charge| (or energy) capacity.\n|Electric vehicle batteries differ from |starting, lighting, and ignition| (SLI) batteries as they are designed to give power over sustained periods of time and are |deep-cycle batteries|. Batteries for electric vehicles are characterized by their relatively high |power-to-weight ratio|, |specific energy| and |energy density|; smaller, lighter batteries are desirable because they reduce the weight of the vehicle and therefore improve its performance. Compared to liquid fuels, most current battery technologies have much lower |specific energy|, and this often impacts the maximum all-electric range of the vehicles.\n|The most common battery type in modern |electric vehicles| are lithium-ion and |lithium polymer|, because of their high energy density compared to their weight.  Other types of rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles include |lead–acid| ("flooded", deep-cycle, and |valve regulated lead acid|), |nickel-cadmium|, |nickel–metal hydride|, and, less commonly, |zinc–air|, and |sodium nickel chloride ("zebra")| batteries.|[1]| The amount of electricity (i.e. electric charge) stored in batteries is measured in |ampere hours| or in |coulombs|, with the total energy often measured in |kilowatt-hours| (kWh).\n|Since the late 1990s, advances in lithium-ion battery technology have been driven by demands from portable electronics, laptop computers, mobile phones, and power tools. The BEV and HEV marketplace has reaped the benefits of these advances both in performance and energy density. Unlike earlier battery chemistries, notably |nickel-cadmium|, lithium-ion batteries can be discharged and recharged daily and at any state of charge.\n|The battery pack makes up a significant cost of a BEV or a HEV. As of December\xa02019|[update]|, the cost of electric vehicle batteries has fallen 87% since 2010 on a per kilowatt-hour basis.|[2]| As of 2018, vehicles with over 250\xa0mi (400\xa0km) of all-electric range, such as the |Tesla Model S|, have been commercialized and are now available in numerous vehicle segments.|[3]|\n|In terms of operating costs, the price of electricity to run a BEV is a small fraction of the cost of fuel for equivalent internal combustion engines, reflecting higher |energy efficiency|.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Electric vehicle battery types|\n|\n|1.1| |Lead-acid|\n|1.2| |Nickel-metal hydride|\n|1.3| |Zebra|\n|1.4| |Lithium-ion|\n|1.5| |Battery capacity|\n|\n|\n|2| |Battery cost|\n|3| |EV parity|\n|\n|3.1| |Cost parity|\n|3.2| |Range parity|\n|\n|\n|4| |Specifics|\n|\n|4.1| |Internal components|\n|4.2| |Recharging|\n|\n|4.2.1| |Recharging time|\n|4.2.2| |Connectors|\n|4.2.3| |Recharging spots|\n|4.2.4| |Travel range before recharging|\n|4.2.5| |Trailers|\n|4.2.6| |Swapping and removing|\n|4.2.7| |Re-filling|\n|\n|\n|4.3| |Lifecycle of lithium-based EV batteries|\n|\n|4.3.1| |Manufacturing|\n|\n|4.3.1.1| |Reusing and repurposing|\n|4.3.1.2| |Recycling|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|4.4| |Environmental impact|\n|4.5| |Vehicle-to-grid|\n|4.6| |Safety|\n|4.7| |Patents|\n|\n|\n|5| |Research, development and innovation|\n|\n|5.1| |Ultracapacitors|\n|5.2| |Promotion in the United States|\n|5.3| |Promotion in Norway|\n|\n|\n|6| |See also|\n|\n|6.1| |Examples|\n|6.2| |Related|\n|\n|\n|7| |References|\n|8| |External links|\n|\n|\n|Electric vehicle battery types|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |rechargeable battery|\n| |Old: Banks of conventional lead-acid car batteries are still used for propulsion of some BEVs.|\n| |Cylindrical cell (18650) prior to assembly|\n| |Lithium ion battery| monitoring electronics (over- and discharge protection)|\n|Lead-acid|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Lead–acid battery|\n|Flooded lead-acid batteries are the oldest, cheapest, and, in the past, most common vehicle batteries available. There are two main types of lead-acid batteries: automobile engine starter batteries, and deep cycle batteries. Automobile engine starter batteries are designed to use a small percentage of their capacity to provide high charge rates to start the engine, while deep cycle batteries are used to provide continuous electricity to run electric vehicles like forklifts or golf carts. Deep cycle batteries are also used as the auxiliary batteries in recreational vehicles, but they require different, multi-stage charging.|[4]| No lead acid battery should be discharged below 50% of its capacity, as it shortens the battery\'s life.|[4]| Flooded batteries require inspection of electrolyte levels and occasional replacement of water, which gases away during the normal charging cycle.\n|Previously, most electric vehicles used lead-acid batteries due to their mature technology, high availability, and low cost, with the notable exception of some early BEVs, such as the |Detroit Electric| which used a |nickel–iron battery|. Deep-cycle lead batteries are expensive and have a shorter life than the vehicle itself, typically needing replacement every 3\xa0years.\n|Lead-acid batteries in EV applications end up being a significant (25–50%) portion of the final vehicle mass. Like all batteries, they have significantly lower specific energy than petroleum fuels—in this case, 30–50\xa0W⋅h/kg. While the difference isn\'t as extreme as it first appears due to the lighter drive-train in an EV, even the best batteries tend to lead to higher masses when applied to vehicles with a normal range. The efficiency (70–75%) and storage capacity of the current generation of common deep cycle lead acid batteries decreases with lower temperatures, and diverting power to run a heating coil reduces efficiency and range by up to 40%.|[|citation needed|]|\n|Charging and operation of batteries typically results in the emission of |hydrogen|, |oxygen| and |sulfur|, which are naturally occurring and normally harmless if properly vented. Early |Citicar| owners discovered that, if not vented properly, unpleasant sulfur smells would leak into the cabin immediately after charging.\n|Lead-acid batteries powered such early modern EVs as the original versions of the |EV1|.\n|\n|Nickel-metal hydride|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Nickel–metal hydride battery|\n| |GM Ovonic NiMH battery module|\n|Nickel-metal hydride batteries are now considered a relatively |mature technology|.|[5]| While less efficient (60–70%) in charging and discharging than even lead-acid, they have a specific energy of 30–80\xa0W⋅h/kg, far higher than lead-acid. When used properly, nickel-metal hydride batteries can have exceptionally long lives, as has been demonstrated in their use in |hybrid cars| and in the surviving first-generation NiMH |Toyota RAV4\xa0EVs| that still operate well after 100,000 miles (160,000\xa0km) and over a decade of service. Downsides include the poor efficiency, high self-discharge, very finicky charge cycles, and poor performance in cold weather.\n|GM Ovonic produced the NiMH battery used in the second generation EV-1, and Cobasys makes a nearly identical battery (ten 1.2\xa0V 85\xa0A⋅h NiMH cells in series in contrast with eleven cells for Ovonic battery). This worked very well in the EV-1.|[6]| |Patent encumbrance| has limited the use of these batteries in recent years.\n|\n|Zebra|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Molten salt battery|\n|The sodium nickel chloride or "Zebra" battery uses a molten |sodium chloroaluminate| (NaAlCl|4|) salt as the electrolyte. A relatively mature technology, the Zebra battery has a specific energy of 120\xa0W⋅h/kg. Since the battery must be heated for use, cold weather does not strongly affect its operation except for increasing heating costs. They have been used in several EVs such as the |Modec| |commercial vehicle|.|[7]| Zebra batteries can last for a few thousand charge cycles and are nontoxic. The downsides to the Zebra battery include poor specific power (<300\xa0W/kg) and the requirement of having to heat the electrolyte to about 270\xa0°C (518\xa0°F), which wastes some energy, presents difficulties in long-term storage of charge, and is potentially a hazard.\n|\n|Lithium-ion|[|edit|]|\n|Main articles: |Lithium-ion battery| and |Lithium polymer battery|\n| |A man cutting open a lithium-ion battery for use in an |electric vehicle|\n|lithium-ion (and the mechanistically similar lithium polymer) batteries, were initially developed and commercialized for use in laptops and consumer electronics. With their high energy density and long cycle life they have become the leading battery type for use in EVs. The first commercialized lithium-ion chemistry was a lithium cobalt oxide |cathode| and a graphite |anode| first demonstrated by N. Godshall in 1979, and by |John Goodenough|, and |Akira Yoshino| shortly thereafter.|[8]|[9]|[10]|[11]| The downside of traditional lithium-ion batteries include sensitivity to temperature, low temperature power performance, and performance degradation with age.|[12]| Due to the volatility of organic electrolytes, the presence of highly oxidized metal oxides, and the thermal instability of the anode SEI layer, traditional lithium-ion batteries pose a fire safety risk if punctured or charged improperly.|[13]| These early cells did not accept or supply charge when extremely cold, and so heaters can be necessary in some climates to warm them. The maturity of this technology is moderate. The |Tesla Roadster (2008)| and other cars produced by the company used a modified form of traditional lithium-ion "laptop battery" cells.\n|Recent EVs are using new variations on lithium-ion chemistry that sacrifice specific energy and specific power to provide fire resistance, environmental friendliness, rapid charging (as quickly as a few minutes), and longer lifespans. These variants (phosphates, titanates, spinels, etc.) have been shown to have a much longer lifetime, with |A123| types using |lithium iron phosphate| lasting at least more than 10 years and more than 7000 charge/discharge cycles,|[14]| and LG Chem expecting their |lithium-manganese spinel| batteries to last up to 40\xa0years.|[|citation needed|]|\n|Much work is being done on lithium-ion batteries in the lab.|[15]| Lithium vanadium oxide has already made its way into the |Subaru| prototype |G4e|, doubling energy density.|[|citation needed|]| Silicon nanowires,|[16]|[17]| silicon nanoparticles,|[18]| and tin nanoparticles|[19]|[20]| promise several times the energy density|[|clarification needed|]| in the anode, while composite|[21]|[22]| and superlattice|[23]| cathodes also promise significant density improvements.\n|New data has shown that exposure to heat and the use of fast charging promote the degradation of Li-ion batteries more than age and actual use, and that the average electric vehicle battery will retain 90% of its initial capacity after six years and six months of service. For example, the battery in a |Nissan Leaf| will degrade twice as fast as the battery in a Tesla, because the Leaf does not have an active cooling system for its battery.|[24]|\n|\n|Battery capacity|[|edit|]|\n|Non–plug-in hybrid cars have battery capacities between 0.65\xa0kW⋅h (2012 |Honda Civic Hybrid|) and 1.8\xa0kW⋅h (2001 |Toyota Prius|).\n|Plug-in hybrid cars have battery capacities between 4.4\xa0kW⋅h (2012 |Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid|) and 40.6 \xa0kW⋅h (|Li Auto One|).\n|All-electric cars have battery capacities between 6.0\xa0kW⋅h (2012 |Renault Twizy|) and 212.7\xa0kW⋅h (2022 |GMC Hummer EV|[25]|).\n|\n|Battery cost|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |rechargeable battery §\xa0Price history|\n| |Learning curve| of lithium-ion batteries: the price of batteries declined by 97% in three decades.|[26]|[27]|\n| |Prototypes of 50\xa0W⋅h/kg |lithium-ion-polymer battery|. Newer Li-ion cells can provide up to 265\xa0W⋅h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles.|\n|In 2010, scientists at the |Technical University of Denmark| paid US$10,000 for a certified EV battery with 25\xa0kWh capacity (i.e. US$400/kWh), with no rebates or surcharges.|[28]| Two out of 15 battery producers could supply the necessary technical documents about quality and fire safety.|[29]| In 2010 it was estimated that at most 10\xa0years would pass before the battery price would come down to one-third.|[28]|\n|According to a 2010 study, by the |United States National Research Council|, the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack was about |US$1,700|/|kWh| of usable energy, and considering that a |PHEV|-10 requires about 2.0\xa0kWh and a PHEV-40 about 8\xa0kWh, the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a PHEV-10 is around |US$3,000| and it goes up to |US$14,000| for a PHEV-40.|[30]|[31]| The |MIT Technology Review| estimated the cost of automotive battery packs to be between |US$225| to |US$500| per kilowatt hour by 2020.|[32]| A 2013 study by the |American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy| reported that battery costs came down from |US$1,300|/kWh in 2007 to |US$500|/kWh in 2012. The |U.S. Department of Energy| has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of |US$300|/kWh in 2015 and |US$125|/kWh by 2022. Cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.|[33]| In 2016, the world had a Li-ion production capacity of 41.57\xa0GW⋅h.|[34]|\n|The actual costs for cells are subject to much debate and speculation as most EV manufacturers refuse to discuss this topic in detail. However, in October 2015, car maker GM revealed at their annual Global Business Conference that they expected a price of |US$145|/kWh for Li-ion cells entering 2016, substantially lower than other analysts\' cost estimates. GM also expects a cost of |US$100|/kWh by the end of 2021.|[35]|\n|According to a study published in February 2016 by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), battery prices fell 65% since 2010, and 35% just in 2015, reaching |US$350|/kWh. The study concludes that battery costs are on a trajectory to make electric vehicles without |government subsidies| as affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by 2022. BNEF projects that by 2040, long-range electric cars will cost less than |US$22,000| expressed in 2016 dollars. BNEF expects electric car battery costs to be well below |US$120|/kWh by 2030, and to fall further thereafter as new chemistries become available.|[36]|[37]|\n|\n|Battery cost estimate comparison|\n|\n|\n|Battery type|\n|Year|\n|Cost (US$/kWh)\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2021|\n|132|[38]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2016|\n|130|[39]|-145|[35]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2014|\n|200–300|[40]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|500–600|[41]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|400|[42]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|520–650|[43]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|752|[43]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2012|\n|689|[43]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2013|\n|800–1000|[44]|\n|\n|\n|Li-ion|\n|2010|\n|750|[45]|\n|\n|\n|Nickel–metal hydride|\n|2004|\n|750|[46]|\n|\n|\n|Nickel–metal hydride|\n|2013|\n|500–550|[44]|\n|\n|\n|Nickel–metal hydride|\n|\n|350|[47]|\n|\n|\n|Lead–acid|\n|\n|256.68\n|\n|EV parity|[|edit|]|\n|In 2010, battery professor Poul Norby stated that he believed that lithium batteries will need to double their specific energy and bring down the price from US$500 (2010) to US$100 per |kWh| capacity in order to make an impact on petrol cars.|[48]| |Citigroup| indicates US$230/kWh.\n|Toyota Prius 2012 plug-in\'s official page declare 21 kilometres (13\xa0mi) of range and a battery capacity of 5.2\xa0kWh with a ratio of 4 kilometres (2.5\xa0mi)/kWh, while the Addax (2015 model) utility vehicle already reaches 110 kilometres (68.5\xa0mi) or a ratio of 7.5 kilometers (4.6\xa0mi)/kWh.|[49]|\n|Battery electric cars have an |energy consumption| between 2.5 miles (4.0\xa0km)/kWh (85 |MPGe|) and 5.0 miles (8.0\xa0km)/kWh (135 MPGe).\n|United States Secretary of Energy| |Steven Chu| predicted costs for a 40-mile range battery will drop from a price in 2008 of US$12,000 to US$3,600 in 2015 and further to US$1,500 by 2020.|[50]|[51]| lithium-ion, Li-poly, |Aluminium-air batteries| and |zinc-air batteries| have demonstrated specific energies high enough to deliver range and recharge times comparable to conventional fossil fueled vehicles.\n|\n|Cost parity|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Electric vehicle conversion|\n|Different costs are important. One issue is purchase price, the other issue is total cost of ownership. As of 2015, electric cars are more expensive to initially purchase, but cheaper to run, and in at least some cases, total cost of ownership may be lower.\n|According to |Kammen et al., 2008|, new PEVs would become cost efficient to consumers if battery prices would decrease from US$1300/kWh to about US$500/kWh (so that the battery may pay for itself).|[52]|\n|In 2010, the |Nissan Leaf| battery pack was reportedly produced at a cost of US$18,000.|[53]| Nissan\'s initial production costs at the launch of the Leaf were therefore about US$750 per kilowatt hour (for the 24\xa0kWh battery).|[53]|\n|In 2012, |McKinsey Quarterly| linked battery prices to gasoline prices on a basis of 5-year |total cost of ownership| for a car, estimating that US$3.50/gallon equates to US$250/kWh.|[54]| In 2017 |McKinsey| estimated that electric cars will be competitive at a battery pack cost of US$100/kWh (expected around 2030), and expects pack costs to be US$190/kWh by 2020.|[55]|\n|In October 2015, car maker GM revealed at their annual Global Business Conference that they expected a price of US$145 per kilowatt hour for Li-ion cells entering 2016.|[35]|\n|\n|Range parity|[|edit|]|\n|Driving range parity means that the electric vehicle has the same range as an average all-combustion vehicle (500 kilometres or 310 miles), with batteries of specific energy greater than 1\xa0|kWh/kg|.|[56]| Higher range means that the electric vehicles would run more kilometers without recharge.

Battery pack between the axles.|\n|Battery pack designs for electric vehicles (EVs) are complex and vary widely by manufacturer and specific application. However, they all incorporate a combination of several simple mechanical and electrical component systems which perform the basic required functions of the pack.\n|The actual battery cells can have different chemistry, physical shapes, and sizes as preferred by various pack manufacturers. Battery packs will always incorporate many discrete cells connected in series and parallel to achieve the total voltage and current requirements of the pack. Battery packs for all electric drive EVs can contain several hundred individual cells. Each cell has a nominal voltage of 3-4 |volts|, depending on its chemical composition.\n|To assist in manufacturing and assembly, the large stack of cells is typically grouped into smaller stacks called modules. Several of these modules are placed into a single pack. Within each module the cells are welded together to complete the electrical path for current flow. Modules can also incorporate cooling mechanisms, temperature monitors, and other devices. Modules must remain within a specific temperature range for optimal performance.|[63]| In most cases, modules also allow for monitoring the voltage produced by each battery cell in the stack by using a |battery management system| (BMS).|[64]|\n|The battery cell stack has a main fuse which limits the current of the pack under a short circuit. A "service plug" or "service disconnect" can be removed to split the battery stack into two electrically isolated halves. With the service plug removed, the exposed main terminals of the battery present no high potential electrical danger to service technicians.|[64]|[65]|\n|The battery pack also contains relays, or contactors, which control the distribution of the battery pack\'s electrical power to the output terminals. In most cases there will be a minimum of two main relays which connect the battery cell stack to the main positive and negative output terminals of the pack, which then supply high current to the electrical drive motor. Some pack designs include alternate current paths for pre-charging the drive system through a pre-charge resistor or for powering an auxiliary bus which will also have their own associated control relays. For safety reasons these relays are all normally open.|[64]|[65]|\n|The battery pack also contains a variety of temperature, voltage, and current sensors. Collection of data from the pack sensors and activation of the pack relays are accomplished by the pack\'s battery monitoring unit (BMU) or BMS. The BMS is also responsible for communications with the vehicle outside the battery pack.|[64]|\n|\n|Recharging|[|edit|]|\n|Batteries in BEVs must be periodically recharged. BEVs most commonly charge from the |power grid| (at home or using a street or shop |recharging point|), which is in turn generated from a variety of domestic resources, such as |coal|, |hydroelectricity|, |nuclear|, |natural gas|, and others. Home or grid power, such as |photovoltaic| solar cell panels, |wind|, or |microhydro| may also be used and are promoted because of concerns regarding |global warming|.\n|With suitable power supplies, good battery lifespan is usually achieved at charging rates not exceeding half of the capacity of the battery per hour (|"0.5|C|"|),|[66]| thereby taking two or more hours for a full charge, but faster charging is available even for large capacity batteries.|[67]|\n|Charging time at home is limited by the capacity of the household |electrical outlet|, unless specialized electrical wiring work is done.  In the US, Canada, Japan, and other countries with 120|\xa0|V electricity, a normal household outlet delivers 1.5 |kilowatts|. In other countries with 230|\xa0|V electricity between 7 and 14 kilowatts can be delivered (230|\xa0|V single phase and 400|\xa0|V three-phase, respectively). In Europe, a 400|\xa0|V (three-phase 230|\xa0|V) grid connection is increasingly popular since newer houses don\'t have natural gas connection due to the European Union\'s safety regulations.\n|\n|Recharging time|[|edit|]|\n|Electric cars like |Tesla Model S|, |Renault Zoe|, |BMW i3|, etc., can recharge their batteries to 80 percent at quick charging stations within 30 minutes.|[68]|[69]|[70]|[71]|  For example, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range charging on a 250\xa0kW Tesla Version 3 Supercharger went from 2% state of charge with 6 miles (9.7\xa0km) of range to 80% state of charge with 240 miles (390\xa0km) of range in 27 minutes, which equates to 520 miles (840\xa0km) per hour.|[72]|\n|\n|Connectors|[|edit|]|\n|The charging power can be connected to the car in two ways. The first is a direct electrical connection known as |conductive coupling|. This might be as simple as a |mains| lead into a weatherproof |socket| through special high capacity cables with connectors to protect the user from |high voltages|. The modern standard for plug-in vehicle charging is the |SAE|\xa0|1772 conductive connector| (IEC|\xa0|62196 Type|\xa0|1) in the US. The |ACEA| has chosen the |VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2| (IEC|\xa0|62196 Type|\xa0|2) for deployment in Europe, which, without a latch, means unnecessary extra power requirements for the locking mechanism.|[|citation needed|]|\n|The second approach is known as |inductive charging|. A special \'paddle\' is inserted into a slot on the car. The paddle is one winding of a |transformer|, while the other is built into the car. When the paddle is inserted it completes a magnetic circuit which provides power to the battery pack. In one inductive charging system,|[73]| one winding is attached to the underside of the car, and the other stays on the floor of the garage. The advantage of the inductive approach is that there is no possibility of |electrocution| as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks, special connectors and |ground fault detectors| can make conductive coupling nearly as safe. Inductive charging can also reduce vehicle weight, by moving more charging componentry offboard.|[74]| An inductive charging advocate from Toyota contended in 1998, that overall cost differences were minimal, while a conductive charging advocate from Ford contended that conductive charging was more cost efficient.|[74]|\n|\n|Recharging spots|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |charging station|\n|As of April\xa02020|[update]|, there are 93,439 locations and 178,381 EV charging stations worldwide.|[75]|\n|Though there are a lot of charging stations worldwide, and the number is only growing, an issue with this is that an EV driver may find themselves at a remote charging station with another vehicle plugged in to the only charger or they may find another vehicle parked in the only EV spot. Currently, no laws prohibit unplugging another person\'s vehicle, it is simply ruled by etiquette.|[57]|\n|\n|Travel range before recharging|[|edit|]|\n|The range of a BEV depends on the number and type of batteries used. The weight and type of vehicle as well as terrain, weather, and the |performance of the driver| also have an impact, just as they do on the mileage of |traditional vehicles|. |Electric vehicle conversion| performance depends on a number of factors including the battery chemistry:\n|\n|Lead-acid batteries are the most available and inexpensive. Such conversions generally have a range of 30–80\xa0km (19–50\xa0mi). Production EVs with lead-acid batteries are capable of up to 130\xa0km (81\xa0mi) per charge.|\n|NiMH| batteries have higher specific energy than lead-acid; prototype EVs deliver up to 200\xa0km (120\xa0mi) of range.|\n|New lithium-ion battery-equipped EVs provide 320–480\xa0km (200–300\xa0mi) of range per charge.|[76]| Lithium is also less expensive than nickel.|[77]|\n|Nickel-zinc battery| are cheaper and lighter than |Nickel-cadmium batteries|. They are also cheaper than (but not as light as) lithium-ion batteries.|[78]|\n|The |internal resistance| of some batteries may be significantly increased at low temperature|[79]| which can cause noticeable reduction in the range of the vehicle and on the lifetime of the battery.\n|Finding the economic balance of range versus performance, battery capacity versus weight, and battery type versus cost challenges every EV manufacturer.\n|With an AC system or advanced DC system, |regenerative braking| can extend range by up to 50% under extreme traffic conditions without complete stopping. Otherwise, the range is extended by about 10 to 15% in city driving, and only negligibly in highway driving, depending upon terrain.|[|citation needed|]|\n|BEVs (including buses and trucks) can also use |genset trailers| and |pusher trailers| in order to extend their range when desired without the additional weight during normal short range use. Discharged basket trailers can be replaced by recharged ones en route. If rented then maintenance costs can be deferred to the agency.\n|Some  BEVs can become |Hybrid vehicles| depending on the trailer and car types of energy and powertrain.\n|\n|Trailers|[|edit|]|\n|Auxiliary battery capacity carried in trailers can increase the overall vehicle range, but also increases the loss of power arising from |aerodynamic drag|, increases |weight transfer| effects and reduces |traction| capacity.\n|\n|Swapping and removing|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |battery swapping|\n|An alternative to recharging is to exchange drained or nearly drained batteries (or |battery range extender modules|) with fully charged batteries. This is called battery swapping and is done in |exchange stations|.|[80]|\n|Features of swap stations include:|[81]|\n|\n|The consumer is no longer concerned with battery capital cost, life cycle, technology, maintenance, or warranty issues;|\n|Swapping is far faster than charging: battery swap equipment built by the firm |Better Place| has demonstrated automated swaps in less than 60\xa0seconds;|[82]|\n|Swap stations increase the feasibility of distributed energy storage via the electric grid;|\n|Concerns about swap stations include:\n|\n|Potential for fraud (battery quality can only be measured over a full discharge cycle; battery lifetime can only be measured over repeated discharge cycles; those in the swap transaction cannot know if they are getting a worn or reduced effectiveness battery; battery quality degrades slowly over time, so worn batteries will be gradually forced into the system)|\n|Manufacturers\' unwillingness to standardize battery access / implementation details|[83]|\n|Safety concerns|[83]|\n|Re-filling|[|edit|]|\n|Zinc-bromine flow batteries| can be re-filled using a liquid, instead of recharged by connectors, saving time.\n|\n|Lifecycle of lithium-based EV batteries|[|edit|]|\n| |Schematic of life cycle of EV batteries. Adapted from Engel et al.|[84]|\n|There are mainly four stages during the lifecycle  of  lithium-based  EV  batteries:  the raw materials phase, the battery manufacturing, operation phase and the end-of-life management phase. As shown in the schematic of life cycle of EV batteries, during the first stage, the rare earth materials are extracted in different parts of the world. After they are refined by pre-processing factories, the battery manufacturing companies take over these materials and start to produce batteries and assemble them into packs.  These battery packs are then sent to car manufacturing companies for EV integration.  In the last  stage,  if  no  management  is  in  place, valuable materials in the batteries could be potentially wasted.  A good end-of-life management phase will try to close the loop.  The used battery packs will either be reused as stationary storage or recycled depending on the battery state of health (SOH).|[84]|\n|The battery lifecycle is rather long and requires close cooperation between companies and countries.  Currently, the raw materials phase and the battery manufacturing and operation phase are well established.  The end-of-life management phase is struggled to grow, especially the recycling  process mainly because of economics.  For example, only 6% of lithium-ion batteries were collected for recycling in 2017–2018 in Australia.|[85]| However, closing the loop is extremely important. Not only because of a predicted tightened supply of nickel, cobalt and lithium in the future, also recycling EV batteries has the potential to maximize the environmental benefit. Xu et al. predicted that in the sustainable development scenario, lithium, cobalt and nickel will reach or surpass the amount of known reserves in the future if no recycling is in place.|[86]| Ciez and Whitacre found that by deploying battery recycling some green house gas (GHG) emission from mining could be avoided.|[87]|\n|\n| |Battery recycling emissions under US average electricity grid. (a,b) for cylindrical cell and (c,d) for pouch cell. Adapted from Ciez and Whitacre.|[87]|\n| |Manufacturing process of EV batteries|\n|To develop a deeper understanding of the lifecycle of EV batteries, it is important to analyze the emission associated with different phases. Using NMC cylindrical cells as an example, Ciez and Whitacre found that around 9\xa0kg CO|2|e kg battery|−|1| is emitted during raw materials pre-processing and battery manufacturing under the US average electricity grid. The biggest part of the emission came from materials preparation accounting for more than 50% of the emissions. If NMC pouch cell is used, the total emission increases to almost 10\xa0kg CO|2|e kg battery|−|1| while materials manufacturing still contributes to more than 50% of the emission.|[87]| During the end-of-life management phase, the refurbishing process adds little emission to the lifecycle emission. The recycling process, on the other hand, as suggested by Ciez and Whitacre emits a significant amount of GHG. As shown in the battery recycling emission plot a and c, the emission of the recycling process varies with the different recycling processes, different chemistry and different form factor. Thus, the net emission avoided compared to not recycling also varies with these factors. At a glance, as shown in the plot b and d, the direct recycling process is the most ideal process for recycling pouch cell batteries, while the hydrometallurgical process is most suitable for cylindrical type battery. However, with the error bars shown, the best approach cannot be picked with confidence. It is worth noting that for the lithium iron phosphates (LFP) chemistry, the net benefit is negative. Because LFP cells lacks cobalt and nickel which are expensive and energy intensive to produce, it is more energetically efficient to mine. In general, in addition to promoting the growth of a single sector, a more integrated effort should be in place to reduce the lifecycle emission of EV batteries. A finite total supply of rare earth material can apparently justify the need for recycling. But the environmental benefit of recycling needs closer scrutiny. Based on current recycling technology, the net benefit of recycling depends on the form factors, the chemistry and the recycling process chosen.\n|\n|Manufacturing|[|edit|]|\n|There are mainly three stages during the manufacturing process of EV batteries: materials manufacturing, cell manufacturing and integration, as shown in Manufacturing process of EV batteries graph in grey, green and orange color respectively. This shown process does not include manufacturing of cell hardware, i.e. casings and current collectors. During the materials manufacturing process, the active material, conductivity additives, polymer binder and solvent are mixed first. After this, they are coated on the current collectors ready for the drying process. During this stage, the methods of making active materials depend on the electrode and the chemistry. For the cathode, two of the most popular chemistry are transition metal oxides, i.e. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (Li-NMC) and Lithium metal phosphates, i.e. Lithium iron phosphates (LFP). For the anode, the most popular chemistry now is graphite. However, recently there have been a lot of companies started to make Si mixed anode (|Sila Nanotech|, |Prologium|) and Li metal anode(|Cuberg|, |Solid Power|). In general, for active materials production, there are three steps: materials preparation, materials processing and refinement. Schmuch et al. discussed materials manufacturing in greater details.|[88]|\n|In the cell manufacturing stage, the prepared electrode will be processed to the desired shape for packaging in a cylindrical, rectangular or pouch format. Then after filling the electrolytes and sealing the cells, the battery cells are cycled carefully to form SEI protecting the anode. Then, these batteries are assembled into packs ready for vehicle integration. Kwade et al. discuss the overall battery manufacturing process in greater detail.\n|\n|Reusing and repurposing|[|edit|]|\n|When an EV battery pack degrades to 70% to 80% of its original capacity, it is defined to reach the end-of-life. One of the waste management methods is to reuse the pack. By repurposing the pack for stationary storage, more value can be extracted from the battery pack while reducing the per kWh lifecycle impact. However, enabling battery second-life is not easy. Several challenges are hindering the development of the battery refurbishing industry.\n|First, uneven and undesired battery degradation happens during EV operation. Each battery cell could degrade differently during operation. Currently, the state of health (SOH) information from a battery management system (BMS) can be extracted on a pack level. Getting the cell state of health information requires next-generation BMS. In addition, because a lot of factors could contribute to the low SOH at the end of life, such as temperature during operation, charging/discharging pattern and calendar degradation, the degradation mechanism could be different. Thus, just knowing the SOH is not enough to ensure the quality of the refurbished pack. To solve this challenge, engineers can mitigate the degradation by engineering the next-generation thermal management system. To fully understand the degradation inside the battery, computational methods including the first-principle method, physics-based model and machine learning based method should work together to identify the different degradation modes and quantify the level of degradation after severe operations. Lastly, more efficient battery characteristics tools, for instance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) should be used to ensure the quality of the battery pack.|[89]|[90]|\n|\n| |Examples of storage projects using second-life EV batteries. Adapted from Awan|[89]|\n|Second, it is costly and time-intensive to disassemble modules and cells. Following the last point, the first step is testing to determine the remaining SOH of the battery modules. This operation could vary for each retired system. Next, the module must be fully discharged. Then, the pack must be disassembled and reconfigured to meet the power and energy requirement of the second life application. It is important to note that qualified workers and specialized tools are required to dismantle the high weight and high voltage EV batteries. Besides the solutions discussed in the previous section, a refurbishing company can sell or reuse the discharged energy from the module to reduce the cost of this process. To accelerate the disassembly process, there have been several attempts to incorporate robots in this process. In this case, robots can handle more dangerous task increasing the safety of the dismantling process.|[89]|[91]|\n|Third, battery technology is non-transparent and lacks standards. Because battery development is the core part of EV, it is difficult for the manufacturer to label the exact chemistry of cathode, anode and electrolytes on the pack. In addition, the capacity and the design of the cells and packs changes on a yearly basis. The refurbishing company needs to closely work with the manufacture to have a timely update on this information. On the other hand, government can set up labeling standard.|[89]|\n|Lastly, the refurbishing process adds cost to the used batteries. Since 2010, the battery costs have decreased by over 85% which is significantly faster than the prediction. Because of the added cost of refurbishing, the refurbished unit may be less attractive than the new batteries to the market.|[89]|\n|Nonetheless, there have been several successes on the second-life application as shown in the examples of storage projects using second-life EV batteries. They are used in less demanding stationary storage application as peak shaving or additional storage for renewable-based generating sources.|[89]|\n|\n|Recycling|[|edit|]|\n| |Examples of current lithium-ion battery recycling facilities. Adapted from Awan|[89]|\n|Although battery life span can be extended by enabling a second-life application, ultimately EV batteries need to be recycled. Recyclability is not currently an important design consideration for battery manufacturers, and in 2019 only 5% of electric vehicle batteries were recycled.|[92]| BEV technologies lack an established recycling framework in many countries, making the usage of BEV and other battery-operated electrical equipment a large energy expenditure, ultimately increasing CO|2| emissions - especially in countries lacking renewable energy resources.|[93]| Currently, there are five types of recycling processes: Pyrometallurgical recovery, Physical materials separation, Hydrometallurgical metal reclamation, Direct recycling method and Biological metals reclamation. The most widely used processes are the first three processes listed, as shown in the examples of current lithium-ion battery recycling facilities. The last two methods are still on lab or pilot scale, however, they can potentially avoid the largest amount of emission from mining.\n|The pyrometallurgical process involves burning the battery materials with slag, limestone, sand and coke to produce a metal alloy using a high-temperature furnace. The resulted materials are a metallic alloy, slag and gases. The gases comprise molecules that are evaporated from the electrolyte and binder components. The metal alloy can be separated through hydrometallurgical processes into constituent materials. The slag which is a mixture of metals aluminum, manganese and lithium can either be reclaimed by hydrometallurgical processes or used in the cement industry. This process is very versatile and relatively safe. Because there is no pre-sorting needed, it can work with a wide variety of batteries. In addition, because the whole cell is burnt, the metal from the current collectors could help the smelting process and because of the exothermic reaction of burning electrolyte sand plastics the energy consumption can also be reduced. However, this process still requires relatively higher energy consumption and only a limited number of materials can be reclaimed. Physical materials separation recovered materials by mechanical crushing and exploiting physical properties of different components such as particle size, density, ferromagnetism and hydrophobicity. Copper, aluminum and steel casing can be recovered by sorting. The remaining materials, called "black mass", which is composed of nickel, cobalt, lithium and manganese, need a secondary treatment to recover. For the hydrometallurgical process, the cathode materials need to be crushed to remove the current collector. Then, the cathode materials are leached by aqueous solutions to extract the desired metals from cathode materials. Direct cathode recycling as the name suggested extracts the materials directly, yielding a cathode power that is ready to be used as new cathode pristine material. This process involves extracting the electrolyte using liquid or supercritical CO|2|.\xa0 After the size of the recovered components is reduced, the cathode materials can be separated out. For the biological metals reclamation or bio-leaching, the process uses microorganisms to digest metal oxides selectively. Then, recyclers can reduce these oxides to produce metal nanoparticles. Although bio-leaching has been used successfully in the mining industry, this process is still nascent to the recycling industry and plenty of opportunities exists for further investigation.|[87]|[89]|[91]|\n|There have been many efforts around the world to promote recycling technologies development and deployment. In the US, the Department of Energy Vehicle Technologies Offices (VTO) set up two efforts targeting at innovation and practicability of recycling processes. ReCell Lithium Recycling RD center brings in three universities and three national labs together to develop innovative, efficient recycling technologies. Most notably, the direct cathode recycling method was developed by the ReCell center. On the other hand, VTO also set up the battery recycling prize to incentivize American entrepreneurs to find innovative solutions to solve current challenges.|[94]|\n|\n|Environmental impact|[|edit|]|\n|Transition to electric vehicles is estimated to require an 87,000% increase in supply of specific metals by 2060 that need to be mined initially, with recycling (see above) covering part of the demand in future.|[95]| In the UK alone, it is estimated that switching 31.5 million petrol vehicles to electric would require "207,900 tonnes of cobalt, 264,600 tonnes of lithium carbonate, 7,200 tonnes of neodymium and dysprosium, and 2,362,500 tonnes of copper", and a worldwide switch would require 40 times these amounts.|[96]| In 2022 the US government planned to give US states $5 billion over five years for electric vehicle chargers.|[97]| According to IEA 2021 study, mineral supplies need to increase from 400 kilotonnes in 2020 to 11,800 kilotonnes in 2040 in order to cover the demand by EV. This increase creates a number of key challenges, from supply chain (as 60% of production is concentrated in China) to significant impact on climate and environment as result of such a large increase in mining operations.|[98]|\n|\n|Vehicle-to-grid|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Vehicle-to-grid|\n|Smart grid| allows BEVs to provide power to the grid at any time, especially:\n|\n|During |peak load| periods (When the selling price of electricity can be very high. Vehicles can then be recharged during |off-peak| hours at cheaper rates which helps absorb excess night time generation. The vehicles serve as a distributed battery storage system to buffer power.)|\n|During |blackouts|, as backup power sources.|\n|Safety|[|edit|]|\n|The safety issues of battery electric vehicles are largely dealt with by the international standard |ISO| |6469|. This standard is divided into three parts:\n|\n|On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery|\n|Functional safety means and protection against failures|\n|Protection of persons against electrical hazards.|\n|Firefighters| and rescue personnel receive special training to deal with the higher voltages and chemicals encountered in electric and hybrid electric vehicle accidents. While BEV accidents may present unusual problems, such as fires and fumes resulting from rapid battery discharge, many experts agree that BEV batteries are safe in commercially available vehicles and in rear-end collisions, and are safer than gasoline-propelled cars with rear gasoline tanks.|[99]|\n|Usually, |battery performance testing| includes the determination of:\n|\n|State Of Charge| (SOC)|\n|State of Health (SOH)|\n|Energy Efficiency|\n|Performance testing simulates the drive cycles for the drive trains of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) as per the required specifications of car manufacturers (|OEMs|). During these drive cycles, controlled cooling of the battery can be performed, simulating the thermal conditions in the car.\n|In addition, climatic chambers control environmental conditions during testing and allow simulation of the full automotive temperature range and climatic conditions.|[|citation needed|]|\n|\n|Patents|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |open hardware| and |patent encumbrance of large automotive NiMH batteries|\n|Patents| may be used to suppress development or deployment of battery technology. For example, patents relevant to the use of Nickel metal hydride cells in cars were held by an offshoot of |Chevron Corporation|, a petroleum company, who maintained veto power over any sale or licensing of NiMH technology.|[100]|[101]|\n|\n|Research, development and innovation|[|edit|]|\n|As of December 2019, billions of euro in research are planned to be invested around the world for improving batteries.|[102]|[103]|\n|Researchers have come up with some design considerations for contactless BEV chargers. Inductively coupled power transfer (ICPT) systems are made to transfer power efficiently from a primary source (charging station) to one or more secondary sources (BEVs) in a contactless way via magnetic coupling.|[104]|\n|Europe has plans for heavy investment in electric vehicle battery development and production, and Indonesia also aims to produce electric vehicle batteries in 2023, inviting Chinese battery firm GEM and Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd to invest in Indonesia.|[105]|[106]|[107]|[108]|[109]|[110]|[111]|[112]|\n|\n|Ultracapacitors|[|edit|]|\n|Electric double-layer capacitors| (or "ultracapacitors") are used in some electric vehicles, such as AFS Trinity\'s concept prototype, to store rapidly available energy with their high |specific power|, in order to keep batteries within safe resistive heating limits and extend battery life.|[113]|[114]|\n|Since commercially available ultracapacitors have a low specific energy, no production electric cars use ultracapacitors exclusively.\n|In January 2020, |Elon Musk|, CEO of |Tesla|, stated that the advancements in Li-ion battery technology have made ultra-capacitors unnecessary for electric vehicles.|[115]|\n|\n|Promotion in the United States|[|edit|]|\n|The examples and perspective in this section |may not represent a |worldwide view| of the subject|.| You may |improve this section|, discuss the issue on the |talk page|, or create a new section, as appropriate.| |(|June 2019|)| (|Learn how and when to remove this template message|)|\n|There are several kinds of policy measures to make BEVs more desirable. Purchase-based incentives include a tax rebate or a subsidy when buying or registering a modern BEV. Use based policy measures include providing an exemption for congestion charging for BEV users, allowing BEV users to use bus lanes, or giving free parking to BEVs. These can be classified into local and global policy incentives. Local incentives including congestion charge exemptions or free BEV parking in a city only influence those located in this specific area. Global policy incentives including subsidies or national tax rebates apply to anyone in a country.|[116]|\n|In 2009, President |Barack Obama| announced 48 new advanced battery and electric drive projects that would receive US$2.4\xa0billion in funding under the |American Recovery and Reinvestment Act|. The government claimed that these projects would accelerate the development of U.S. manufacturing capacity for batteries and electric drive components as well as the deployment of electric drive vehicles, helping to establish American leadership in creating the next generation of advanced vehicles.|[117]|\n|The announcement marked the single largest investment in advanced battery technology for hybrid and electric-drive vehicles ever made. Industry officials expected that this US$2.4\xa0billion investment, coupled with another US$2.4\xa0billion in cost share from the award winners, would result directly in the creation tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. battery and auto industries.\n|The awards cover US$1.5\xa0billion in |grants| to United States-based manufacturers to produce batteries and their components and to expand battery recycling capacity.\n|\n|U.S. Vice President |Joe Biden| announced in Detroit over US$1\xa0billion in grants to companies and universities based in Michigan. Reflecting the state\'s leadership in clean energy manufacturing, Michigan companies and institutions received the largest share of grant funding of any state. Two companies, |A123 Systems| and |Johnson Controls|, would receive a total of approximately US$550\xa0million to establish a manufacturing base in the state for advanced batteries, and two others, |Compact Power| and |Dow Kokam|,|[118]| would receive a total of over US$300\xa0million for manufacturing battery cells and materials. Large automakers based in Michigan, including GM, Chrysler, and Ford, would receive a total of more than US$400\xa0million to manufacture batteries and electric drive components. Three educational institutions in Michigan — the |University of Michigan|, |Wayne State University| in Detroit, and |Michigan Technological University| in Houghton, in the Upper Peninsula — would receive a total of more than US$10\xa0million for education and workforce training programs to train researchers, technicians, and service providers, and to conduct consumer research to accelerate the transition towards advanced vehicles and batteries.|\n|U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu visited |Celgard|,|[119]| in |Charlotte, North Carolina|, to announce a US$49\xa0million grant for the company to expand its separator production capacity to serve the expected increased demand for lithium-ion batteries from manufacturing facilities in the United States. Celgard was planning to expand its manufacturing capacity in Charlotte, North Carolina, and nearby |Concord, North Carolina|,|[120]| and the company expected the new separator production to come online in 2010. Celgard expected that approximately hundreds of jobs could be created, with the first of those jobs beginning as early as fall 2009.|\n|EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was in St. Petersburg, Florida, to announce a US$95.5\xa0million grant for |Saft America|, Inc.|[121]|[122]| to construct a new plant in |Jacksonville| on the site of the former |Cecil Field| military base, to manufacture lithium-ion cells, modules and battery packs for military, industrial, and agricultural vehicles.|\n|Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation| |John Porcari| visited |East Penn Manufacturing| Co,|[123]| in |Lyon Station, Pennsylvania|, to award the company a US$32.5\xa0million grant to increase production capacity for their |valve regulated lead-acid batteries| and the |UltraBattery|, a |lead-acid battery| combined with a carbon |supercapacitor|, for micro and mild hybrid applications.|[124]|\n|On 2 May 2022, President Biden announced the administration will begin a $3.16 billion plan to boost domestic manufacturing and recycling of batteries, in a larger effort to shift the country away from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles. The goal of the Biden administration is to have half of U.S. automobile production electric by 2030.|[125]|\n|The |Inflation Reduction Act|, passed August 16, 2022, aimed to incentivize clean energy manufacturing with a $7,500 consumer tax credit for EVs with US-built batteries, and subsidies for EV plants. By October 2022, billions of dollars of investment had been announced for over two dozen US battery plants, leading some commentators to nickname the Midwest as the "Battery Belt."|[126]|[127]|\n|\n|Promotion in Norway|[|edit|]|\n|Norway has become a leading example of BEV promotion. The BEV market share is highest in the world in Norway, the main reason being the strong incentives for promoting purchase and ownership of BEVs. Norway has an incentive package for BEVs that often equate or even make a BEV cheaper to purchase than an Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle (ICEV). In addition to the purchase price incentives, there are also incentives that make BEVs more cost-efficient and convenient in daily use. Incentive policies have a clear success for increasing BEV sales in Norway, making it a great case to learn from for other countries wanting to head in the same direction.|[128]|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Examples|[|edit|]|\n|List of hybrid vehicles|\n|List of production battery electric vehicles|\n|List of electric vehicle battery manufacturers|\n|Related|[|edit|]|\n|\n|Battery charging|\n|Battery electric multiple unit|\n|Battery locomotive|\n|Charging station|\n|Dual-mode vehicle|\n|Electric car energy efficiency|\n|Flywheel energy storage|\n|List of battery types|\n|Rechargeable battery|\n|Salt water battery|\n|Traction motor|\n|Vehicle-to-grid| (V2G)|\n|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |"Axeon Receives Order for 50 Zebra Packs for Modec Electric Vehicle; Li-Ion Under Testing"|. |Green Car Congress|. 24 November 2016|.

A |life-cycle assessment| involves production and post-use considerations.

Other approaches include |personal rapid transit|, a |public transportation| concept that offers automated, on-demand, non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways.\n|\n|Electric and fuel cell-powered|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Electric vehicle| and |Plug-in hybrid|\n|Examples of vehicles with reduced petroleum consumption include |electric cars|, |plug-in hybrids| and |fuel cell|-powered |hydrogen cars|.\n|Electric cars| are typically more efficient than |fuel cell|-powered vehicles on a |Tank-to-wheel| basis.|[16]| They have better |fuel economy| than conventional |internal combustion engine| vehicles but are hampered by |range| or maximum distance attainable before discharging the battery. The |electric car batteries| are their main cost. They provide a 0%|[17]| to 99.9% reduction in |CO|2| emissions compared to an |ICE| (gasoline, diesel) vehicle, depending on the source of electricity.|[18]|\n|\n|Hybrid electric vehicles|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Hybrid vehicle|\n|Hybrid cars| may be partly fossil fuel (or biofuel) powered and partly electric or hydrogen-powered. Most combine an internal combustion engine with an electric engine, though other variations too exist. The internal combustion engine is often either a gasoline or Diesel engine (in rare cases a Stirling engine may even be used|[19]|). They are more expensive to purchase but cost redemption is achieved in a period of about 5 years due to better fuel economy.|[14]|[15]|\n|\n|Compressed air cars, stirling vehicles, and others|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Compressed-air vehicle| and |Compressed air car|\n|Compressed air cars|, |stirrling-powered| vehicles, and |Liquid nitrogen vehicles| are less polluting than an electrical vehicles, since the vehicle and its components are environment friendly. However, compressed air vehicles are far beneficial to the environment than vehicles that are considered "eco-friendly". Take the |Toyota Prius|, although it is marketed as an eco-friendly vehicle, it has an environmentally harmful production process. In the words of |Jeremy Clarkson|, a renown British car show host and expert, "The recent study found that in the long term it does more environmental damage than a |Land Rover Discovery|". Alternatively, compressed air vehicles are less environmentally harmful due to their air engine, which allows the car to run on compressed air instead of fuel. The engine is pumped by air instead of gasoline explosions, thus having zero emission motors, no pollution or oil.\n|Solar car races| are held on a regular basis in order to promote green vehicles and other "|green technology|". These sleek driver-only vehicles can travel long distances at highway speeds using only the electricity generated instantaneously from the sun.\n|\n|Improving conventional cars|[|edit|]|\n| |The |Fiat Siena Tetrafuel| 1.4 is a |multifuel| car designed to run as a |flex-fuel| on |gasoline|, or |E20–E25 blend|, or neat ethanol (|E100|); or to run as a |bi-fuel| with |natural gas (CNG)|.|\n|Main articles: |Biofuel|, |compressed natural gas|, and |clean diesel|\n|See also: |Volkswagen emissions scandal|\n|A conventional vehicle can become a greener vehicle by mixing in |renewable fuels| or using less carbon intensive |fossil fuel|. Typical |gasoline|-powered cars can tolerate up to 10% |ethanol|. Brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol, though there were discontinued. Another available option is a |flexible-fuel vehicle| which allows any blend of gasoline and ethanol, up to 85% in North America and Europe, and up to 100% in Brazil.|[20]| Another existing option is to convert a conventional gasoline-powered to allow the alternative use of |CNG|. |Pakistan|, |Argentina|, |Brazil|, |Iran|, |India|, |Italy|, and |China| have the largest fleets of |natural gas vehicles| in the world.|[21]|\n|Diesel|-powered vehicles can often transition completely to |biodiesel|, though the fuel is a very strong |solvent|, which can occasionally damage |rubber| seals in vehicles built before 1994. More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging |filters|, unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel. It is very effective at \'de-coking\' the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean. Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines. Biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some North American national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days. Biodiesel and |vegetable oil fuelled|, diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the US |Tour de Sol| competition.\n|This presents problems, as biofuels can use food resources in order to provide mechanical energy for vehicles. Many experts point to this as a reason for growing food prices, particularly US Bio-ethanol fuel production which has affected maize prices. In order to have a low environmental impact, biofuels should be made only from waste products, or from new sources like |algae|.\n|\n|Electric Motor and Pedal Powered Vehicles|[|edit|]|\n|Multiple companies are offering and developing two, three, and four wheel vehicles combining the characteristics of a bicycle with electric motors. US Federal, State and Local laws do not clearly nor consistently classify|[22]| these vehicles as |bicycles|, |electric bicycles|, |motorcycles|, |electric motorcycles|, |mopeds|, |Neighborhood Electric Vehicle|, |motorised quadricycle| or as a |car|. Some laws have limits on top speeds, power of the motors, range, etc. while others do not.|[23]|[24]|[25]|[26]|\n|\n|Other|[|edit|]|\n|Further information: |Personal rapid transit|\n| |Solar vehicle|\n|Public transportation| vehicles are not usually included in the green vehicle category, but |Personal rapid transit| (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track have the advantage of potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential |PRT energy efficiency| is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.|\n|Solar vehicles| are |electric vehicles| powered by |solar energy| obtained from |solar panels| on the surface (generally, the roof) of the vehicle. |Photovoltaic| (PV) cells convert the Sun\'s energy directly into |electrical energy|. Solar vehicles are not practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. However, some cities have begun offering |solar-powered buses|, including the |Tindo| in |Adelaide, Australia|.|\n|Wind-powered electric vehicles| primarily use wind-turbines installed at a strategic point of the vehicle, which are then converted into electric energy which causes the vehicle to propel.|\n|Animal powered vehicles|[|edit|]|\n|Horse and carriage| are just one type of animal propelled vehicle. Once a common form of transportation, they became far less common as cities grew and automobiles took their place. In dense cities, the waste produced by large numbers of transportation animals was a significant health problem. Oftentimes the food is produced for them using diesel powered tractors, and thus there is some environmental impact as a result of their use.\n|\n|Human powered vehicles|[|edit|]|\n| |Vélo\'v| |bicycle sharing system| in |Lyon|, |France|\n|See also: |Bicycle sharing system|\n|Human-powered transport| includes walking, |bicycles|, |velomobiles|, |row boats|, and other environmentally friendly ways of getting around. In addition to the health benefits of the exercise provided, they are far more environmentally friendly than most other options. The only downside is the speed limitations, and how far one can travel before getting exhausted.\n|\n|Benefits of green vehicle use|[|edit|]|\n|Environmental|[|edit|]|\n|Vehicle emissions contribute to the increasing concentration of gases linked to |climate change|.|[27]|  In order of significance, the principal |greenhouse gases| associated with road transport are carbon dioxide (CO|2|), methane (CH|4|) and nitrous oxide (N|2|O).|[28]| Road transport is the third largest source of greenhouse gases emitted in the UK, and accounts for about 27% of total emissions,|[29]| and 33% in the United States.|[30]|  Of the total |greenhouse gas emissions| from transport, over 85% are due to CO|2| emissions from road vehicles. The transport sector is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases.|[31]|\n|\n|Health|[|edit|]|\n|Vehicle pollutants have been linked to human ill health including the incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer. A 1998 report estimated that up to 24,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK as a direct result of air pollution.|[32]|  According to the |World Health Organization|, up to 13,000 deaths per year among children (aged 0–4 years) across Europe are directly attributable to outdoor pollution. The organization estimates that if pollution levels were returned to within EU limits, more than 5,000 of these lives could be saved each year.\n|\n|Monetary|[|edit|]|\n|Hybrid taxi| |fleet operators| in |New York| have also reported that reduced fuel consumption saves them thousands of dollars per year.|[33]|\n|\n|Criticism|[|edit|]|\n|A study by CNW Marketing Research suggested that the extra energy cost of manufacture, shipping, disposal, and the short lives of some of these types of vehicle (particularly gas-electric |hybrid vehicles|) outweighs any energy savings made by their using less petroleum during their useful lifespan.|[34]|  This type of argument is the long smokestack argument.|[35]|  Critics of the report note that the study prorated all of Toyota\'s hybrid research-and-development costs across the relatively small number of Priuses on the road, rather than using the incremental cost of building a vehicle; used109,000 miles (175,000\xa0km) for the length of life of a Prius (Toyota offers a 150,000-mile (240,000\xa0km) warranty on the Prius\' hybrid components, including the battery), and calculated that a majority of a car\'s cradle-to-grave energy gets expended during the vehicle\'s production, not while it is driven.|[36]|\n|Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman| official Bente Øverli stated that "Cars cannot do anything good for the environment except less damage than others." Based on this opinion, Norwegian law severely restricts the use of "|greenwashing|" to market automobiles, strongly prohibiting advertising a vehicle as being environmentally friendly, with large fines issued to violators.|[37]|[38]|[39]|[40]|\n|Some studies try to compare environmental impact of electric and petrol vehicles over complete life cycle, including production, operation, and dismantling. \n|[41]|\n|[42]|\n|[43]|\n|[44]|\nIn general, results differ vastly dependent on the region considered, due to difference in energy sources to produce electricity that fuels electric vehicles. When considering only CO|2| emissions, it is noted that production of electric cars generate about twice as much emissions as that of internal combustion cars.|[41]| However, emissions of CO|2| during operation are much larger (on average) than during production. For electric cars, emissions caused during operation depend on energy sources used to produce electricity and thus vary a lot geographically. Studies suggest that when taking into account both production and operation, electric cars would cause more emissions in economies where production of electricity is not clean, e.g., it is mostly coal based.|[42]|[43]| For this reason, some studies found that driving electric cars is less environmentally damaging in western US states than in eastern ones, where less electricity is produced using cleaner sources. Similarly, in countries like India, Australia or China, where large portion of electricity is produced by using coal, driving electric vehicles would cause larger environmental damage than driving petrol vehicles. When justifying use of electric cars over petrol cars, these kinds of studies do not provide sufficiently clear results. Environmental impact is calculated based on fuel mix used to produce electricity that powers electric cars. However, when a gas vehicle is replaced by an equivalent electric vehicle, additional power must be installed in electrical grid. This additional capacity would normally not be based on the same ratios of energy sources ("clean" versus fossil fuels) than the current capacity. Only when additional electricity production capacity installed to switch from petrol to electric vehicles would predominantly consist of clean sources, switch to electric vehicles could reduce environmental damage. Another common problem in methodology used in comparative studies is that it only focuses on specific kinds of environmental impact. While some studies focus only on emission of gas pollutants over life cycle or only on greenhouse gas emissions such as CO|2|, comparison should also account for other environmental impacts such as pollutants released otherwise during production and operation or ingredients that can not be effectively recycled.|[45]| Examples include use of lighter high performing metals, lithium batteries and more rare metals in electric cars, which all have high environmental impact.\n|A study that also looked at factors other than energy consumption and carbon emissions has suggested that there is no such thing as an environmentally friendly car.|[46]|\n|The use of vehicles with increased |fuel efficiency| is usually considered positive in the short term but criticism of any hydrocarbon-based personal transport remains.  The |Jevons paradox| suggests that energy efficiency programs are often counter-productive, even increasing energy consumption in the long run.|[47]| Many environmental researchers believe that |sustainable transport| may require a move away from hydrocarbon fuels and from our present automobile and highway paradigm.|[48]|[49]|[50]|\n|\n|National and international promotion|[|edit|]|\n|European Union|[|edit|]|\n|The |European Union| is promoting the marketing of greener cars via a combination of binding and non-binding measures.|[51]| As of April 2010, 15 of the 27 |member states of the European Union| provide tax incentives for |electrically chargeable vehicles| and some |alternative fuel vehicles|, which includes all |Western European| countries except |Italy| and |Luxembourg|, plus the |Czech Republic| and |Romania|. The incentives consist of tax reductions and exemptions, as well as of bonus payments for buyers of |electric cars|, |plug-in hybrids|, |hybrid electric vehicles| and |natural gas vehicles|.|[52]|[53]|\n|\n|United States|[|edit|]|\n|The |United States Environmental Protection Agency| (EPA) is promoting the marketing of greener cars via the |SmartWay| program. The SmartWay and SmartWay Elite designation mean that a vehicle is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles. This US EPA designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle\'s Air Pollution Score and Greenhouse Gas Score. Higher Air Pollution Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog relative to other vehicles. Higher Greenhouse Gas Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide and have improved fuel economy relative to other vehicles.\n|To earn the SmartWay designation, a vehicle must earn at least a 6 on the Air Pollution Score and at least a 6 on the Greenhouse Gas Score, but have a combined score of at least 13. SmartWay Elite is given to those vehicles that score 9 or better on both the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Scores.\n|A Green Vehicle Marketing Alliance, in conjunction with the |Oak Ridge National Laboratory| (ORNL), periodically meets, and coordinates marketing efforts.|[54]|\n|\n|Green car rankings|[|edit|]|\n|This section needs to be |updated|.| Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.| |(|February 2022|)| |Hyundai Ioniq Electric|\n| |BMW i3| electric car|\n| |Toyota Prius Eco| (4th gen)|\n| |Chevrolet Bolt EV|\n| |Chevrolet Volt (2nd gen.)| plug-in hybrid|\n| |Chevrolet Volt| (1st gen) |plug-in hybrid|\n| |Nissan Leaf| |electric car|\n| |Toyota Mirai| |hydrogen| |fuel cell car|\n| |Mitsubishi i-MiEV| electric car|\n| |Ford Focus Electric|\n| |Ford C-Max Energi| plug-in hybrid|\n| |Tesla Model S| electric car|\n| |BMW i8| |plug-in hybrid|\n| |Ford Fusion Energi| plug-in hybrid|\n| |Honda Accord plug-in hybrid|\n| |Honda FCX Clarity| |hydrogen| |fuel cell car|\n| |Toyota Prius (3rd gen)|\n| |Honda Civic Hybrid (2nd gen)|\n| |Ford Fusion Hybrid (1st gen)|\n| |Honda Insight (2nd gen)|\n| |Honda Civic GX|\n|Several automobile magazines, motor vehicle specialized publications and |environmental groups| publish annual rankings or listings of the best green |cars of a given year|.

A key design feature is the car\'s roof-supporting |pillars|, designated from front to rear of the car as A-|pillar|, B-pillar, C-pillar and D-pillar.\n|Common car body configurations are one-box (e.g., a van, minivan, MPV), two-box (e.g., a hatchback) and three-box (e.g., a sedan/saloon) designs.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |One-box design|\n|2| |Two-box design|\n|3| |Three-box design|\n|4| |Car roof classification|\n|5| |See also|\n|6| |References|\n|\n|\n|One-box design|[|edit|]|\n| |A one-box design, the |Renault Twingo| (1998–2000)|\n|A one-box design, also called a |monospace|, |mono-box| or |monovolume| configuration|[1]|—approximates in shape a single volume comprising engine, cabin and cargo areas, in part by locating the base of a vehicle\'s |A-pillars| further forward.|[1]|[2]|\n|One-box designs include |light commercial vehicles|, |minivans|, MPVs and |mini MPVs|. Passenger cars with a one-box design include the 1984 |Renault Espace|, 1992 |Renault Twingo I|, 2008 |Tata Nano|, 2005 |Toyota Aygo|/|Citroën C1|/|Peugeot 107| and 1997 |Mercedes-Benz A-Class|.\n|\n|Two-box design|[|edit|]|\n|Two-box| designs articulate a volume for engine and a volume that combines passenger and cargo volumes, e.g., |station wagon/estate| or (three or five-door) |hatchbacks| like the |Saab 900|, and minivans like the |Chrysler minivan|, 2001 |Volkswagen Polo Mk4| and 1999 |Skoda Fabia| Mk1.|[1]|[2]|\n|\n|Three-box design|[|edit|]|\n| |A three-box |coupé|, the |Fiat 124|\n| |A three-box |hatchback|, the |European Ford Escort|\n| |A three-box |sedan/saloon|, the |Renault Dauphine|\n|Three-box design is a broad automotive styling term describing a |coupé|, |sedan/saloon|, |notchback| or |hatchback| where—when viewed in profile—principal volumes are articulated into three separate compartments or boxes: engine, passenger and cargo.|[1]|\n|Three-box designs are highly variable.  |Hemmings Motor News| said:\n|\n|These three boxes, compartmentalized as they are, are used to denote distinct areas of an automobile—specifically a sedan. The engine under the hood and surrounding compartment is the first box. The passenger seating area is another, or second box. The last or third box is the cargo or trunk area. There is no rule as to which box needs to be where.|[3]|\n|Where the |Renault Dauphine| is a three-box that carries its engine in the rear and its cargo up front, the styling of the |Škoda Octavia| integrates a |hatchback| with the articulation of a three-box. This style was later used by its larger |Škoda Superb|, which marketed as the TwinDoor, within the liftgate operable as a trunk lid or as a full hatchback. As with the third generation European |Ford Escort| (also a hatchback), the third box may be vestigial.  And three-box styling does not need to be boxy: |Car Design News| calls the fluid and rounded |Fiat Linea| a three-box design|[4]|—and most examples of the markedly bulbous styling of the |ponton genre| are three-box designs.\n|In 2012, |Hemmings Motor News| wrote "the three-box sedan design is seen as traditional or—worse—conventional."|[3]| \nBy 2016 In the United States, the three-box sedan began to wane in popularity.|[5]|[6]|  In 2018, the Wall Street Journal wrote: "from gangster getaway cars and the Batmobile to the humble family sedan, the basic three-box configuration of a passenger car—low engine compartment, higher cabin, low trunk in the rear—has endured for decades as the standard shape of the automobile.  Until now."|[5]|\n|Sales and popularity of 4-door notchback sedans/saloons began declining in Europe since mid-1990s, especially affordable ones. This is resulted in moving production of Volkswagen Jetta in Mexico, as well as the Peugeot abandoning that segment since 2001 when the production of |Peugeot 306| ended. Other, predominantly European manufacturers followed suit, with the most recent generation of Opel Astra may no longer to be offered as the 4-door notchback. Since 2018, Ford reduced sales of 4-door |Focus| as well as |Mondeo| to Eastern Balkans markets. Again, Volkswagen stopped sales of |Jetta| in Europe around the same time due to too long dimensions, exceeding those with International |Passat B8|.\n|\n|Car roof classification|[|edit|]|\n|A related classification is based on the style of roof in the car design. The DrivAer aerodynamics model of the Technical University of Munich|[7]| classifies roof styles as (F) |Fastback|, (E) |Estate Back|, (N) |Notchback|/|Sedan|.|[8]|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Ponton styling|\n|Coke bottle styling|\n|Glossary of automotive design|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^ |a| |b| |c| |d| |"Starting Out: Car Design Glossary - Part 2 pg 3"|. |www.cardesignnews.com|.

Based on the model, the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, etc.) and obstacles.|[7]|[8]|[9]|[10]|[11]|\n|Once the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to |impact| the automobile industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields.\n|Autonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels,|[12]| according to a system developed by |SAE International| (SAE J3016).|[13]| The |SAE levels| can be roughly understood as |Level 0| – no automation; |Level 1| – hands on/shared control; |Level 2| – hands off; |Level 3| – eyes off; |Level 4| – mind off, and |Level 5| – steering wheel optional.\n|As of December\xa02022|[update]|, vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor. In December 2020, |Waymo| became the first service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in a part of |Phoenix, Arizona|. In March 2021, |Honda| was the first manufacturer to sell a legally approved Level 3 car.|[14]|[15]|[16]| |Nuro| began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.|[17]| In December 2021, |Mercedes-Benz| received approval for a Level 3 car.|[18]| In February 2022, |Cruise| became the second service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in |San Francisco|.|[19]|\n|As of December\xa02022|[update]|, several manufacturers had scaled back plans for self-driving technology, including |Ford| and |Volkswagen|.|[20]|\n|\n|\n|\n| |Waymo| undergoing testing in the San Francisco Bay Area|\n|\n| |Roborace| autonomous racing car on display at the |2017 New York City ePrix|\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |History|\n|2| |Definitions|\n|\n|2.1| |Terminology and safety considerations|\n|2.2| |Autonomous vs. automated|\n|2.3| |Autonomous versus cooperative|\n|\n|\n|3| |Classifications|\n|\n|3.1| |Self-driving car|\n|3.2| |SAE classification|\n|3.3| |Levels of driving automation|\n|3.4| |Criticism of SAE|\n|\n|\n|4| |Technology|\n|\n|4.1| |General perspectives|\n|4.2| |Hybrid navigation|\n|4.3| |Drive by wire|\n|4.4| |Driver monitoring system|\n|4.5| |Vehicular communication|\n|4.6| |Re-programmable|\n|4.7| |Modularity|\n|4.8| |Homogenization|\n|4.9| |Mathematical safety model|\n|\n|\n|5| |Challenges|\n|\n|5.1| |Obstacles|\n|5.2| |Concerns|\n|5.3| |Human factors|\n|5.4| |Moral issues|\n|\n|\n|6| |Applications|\n|7| |Testing|\n|\n|7.1| |Approaches|\n|7.2| |Disengagements in the 2010s|\n|7.3| |In the 2020s|\n|\n|\n|8| |Incidents|\n|\n|8.1| |Tesla Autopilot|\n|8.2| |Waymo|\n|8.3| |Uber\'s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG)|\n|8.4| |Navya Arma driving system|\n|8.5| |NIO Navigate on Pilot|\n|8.6| |Toyota e-Palette operation|\n|\n|\n|9| |Public opinion surveys|\n|\n|9.1| |In the 2010s|\n|9.2| |In the 2020s|\n|\n|\n|10| |Regulation|\n|11| |Anticipated launch|\n|\n|11.1| |Anticipated Level 2|\n|11.2| |Anticipated Level 3|\n|11.3| |Anticipated Level 4|\n|\n|\n|12| |See also|\n|13| |References|\n|14| |Further reading|\n|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |History of self-driving cars|\n|Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;|[21]| trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19\xa0mph) with the support of an elevated rail.|[22]|[23]|\n|A landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with |Carnegie Mellon University|\'s |Navlab|[24]| and ALV|[25]|[26]| projects funded by the United States\' |Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency| (DARPA) starting in 1984 and |Mercedes-Benz| and |Bundeswehr University Munich|\'s |EUREKA Prometheus Project| in 1987.|[27]| By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19\xa0mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and night time conditions by 1987.|[28]| A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with Carnegie Mellon University\'s Navlab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849\xa0mi (4,585\xa0km) between |Pittsburgh|, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797\xa0mi (4,501\xa0km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8\xa0mph (102.7\xa0km/h).|[29]|[30]|[31]|[32]| From the 1960s through the second |DARPA Grand Challenge| in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.|[33]| Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.|[27]|[34]|[35]|[36]|[37]|[38]|[39]|[40]|[41]|\n|The US allocated US$650\xa0million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.|[42]| Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848\xa0mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797\xa0mi) or 98% of it autonomously.|[43]| Navlab\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400\xa0mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.|[44]| In 2015, the US states of |Nevada|, Florida, California, |Virginia|, and |Michigan|, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.|[45]|\n|From 2016 to 2018, the |European Commission| funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.|[46]| Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.|[47]|\n|In November 2017, |Waymo| announced that it had begun testing driver-less cars without a safety driver in the driver position;|[48]| however, there was still an employee in the car.|[49]| An October 2017 report by the |Brookings Institution| found that the $80\xa0billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was "reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this".|[50]|\n|In October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000\xa0km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.|[51]| In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.|[52]| In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driver-less ride hailing service in Phoenix.|[53]|[54]| The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.|[55]|[54]|\n|In March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series |Roborace|, Robocar set the |Guinness World Record| for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42\xa0km/h (175.49\xa0mph) – an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.|[56]|\n|In 2020, a |National Transportation Safety Board| chairman stated that no self-driving cars (|SAE level 3+|) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\n|\n|There is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when |advanced driver assistance systems| are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\'re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\'t own a self-driving car.|[57]|\n|On 5 March 2021, |Honda| began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 |Legend Hybrid EX| sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous "Traffic Jam Pilot" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.|[14]|[15]|[58]|[16]|\n|\n|Definitions|[|edit|]|\n|There is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\n|In 2014, such confusion has been documented in |SAE J3016| which states that "some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS [automated driving system] at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS)."\n|\n|Terminology and safety considerations|[|edit|]|\n|Modern vehicles provide features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls, or emergency braking. Those features alone are just considered as |driver assistance technologies| because they still require a human driver control while fully automated vehicles drive themselves without human driver input.\n|According to Fortune, some newer vehicles\' technology names—such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot—might confuse the driver, who may believe no driver input is expected when in fact the driver needs to remain involved in the driving task.|[59]| According to the |BBC|, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.|[60]|\n|For this reason, some organizations such as the |AAA| try to provide standardized naming conventions for features such as ALKS which aim to have capacity to manage the driving task, but which are not yet approved to be an automated vehicles in any countries. The |Association of British Insurers| considers the usage of the word |autonomous| in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think "autonomous" and "autopilot" mean a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology able to drive a car is still in its beta stage.\n|Some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are |self-driving| when they are not able to manage some driving situations. Despite being called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its offering should not be considered as a fully autonomous driving system.|[61]| This makes drivers risk becoming excessively confident, taking |distracted driving| behavior, leading to crashes. While in Great-Britain, a fully self-driving car is only a car registered in a specific list.|[62]| There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics.|[63]|\n|According to the SMMT, "There are two clear states – a vehicle is either assisted with a driver being supported by technology or automated where the technology is effectively and safely replacing the driver."|[64]|\n|\n|Autonomous vs. automated|[|edit|]|\n|Autonomous| means self-governing.|[65]| Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been |automated| (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment, and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.|[65]|\n|One approach is to implement |communication networks| both in the immediate vicinity (for |collision avoidance|) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle\'s autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n|As of 2017|[update]|, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. |Euro NCAP| defines autonomous in "|Autonomous Emergency Braking|" as: "the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident", which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.|[66]|\n|In Europe, the words |automated| and |autonomous| might be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles (...) defines "automated vehicle" and "fully automated vehicle" based on their autonomous capacity:|[67]|\n|\n|"automated vehicle" means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required;|[67]|\n|"fully automated vehicle" means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision;|[67]|\n|In British English, the word automated alone might have several meaning, such in the sentence: "Thatcham also found that the |automated| lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as \'|automated| driving\', instead it claims the tech should be classed as "assisted driving".":|[68]| The first occurrence of the "automated" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second occurrence refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. The British law interprets the meaning of "automated vehicle" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle "driving itself" and an |insured vehicle|.|[69]|\n|\n|Autonomous versus cooperative|[|edit|]|\n|To enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle, some companies use a remote driver.|[70]|\n|\nAccording to |SAE J3016|, |Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.|\n|Classifications|[|edit|]|\n|Self-driving car|[|edit|]|\n|PC Magazine| defines a self-driving car as "a computer-controlled car that drives itself".|[71]| The |Union of Concerned Scientists| states that self-driving cars are "cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or "driver-less" cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle."|[72]|\n|The British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines a vehicle as "driving itself" if the vehicle "is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual".|[73]|\n|Another British definition assumes: "Self-driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves."|[74]|\n|\n|SAE classification|[|edit|]|\n| |Tesla Autopilot| is classified as an SAE Level 2 system.|[75]|[76]|\n|A classification system with six levels – ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems – was published in 2014 by standardization body |SAE International| as J3016, |Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems|; the details are revised periodically.|[13]| This classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle\'s capabilities, although these are loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the |National Highway Traffic Safety Administration| (NHTSA) had released its original formal classification system. After SAE updated its classification in 2016, called J3016_201609,|[77]| NHTSA adopted the SAE standard,|[78]| and SAE classification became widely accepted.|[79]|\n|\n|\n|Levels of driving automation|[|edit|]|\n|In SAE\'s automation level definitions, "driving mode" means "a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)"|[1]|[80]|\n|\n|Level 0|: The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.|\n|Level 1| ("hands on"): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed (|Cruise control|) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed (|Adaptive cruise control| or ACC); and |Parking Assistance|, where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. |Lane Keeping Assistance| (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. |Automatic emergency braking| which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to |Autopilot Review| magazine.|[81]|\n|Level 2| ("hands off"): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and |steering|. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand "hands off" is not meant to be taken literally – contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver may be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping their attention to traffic. Actual hands off driving is sometimes considered level 2.5, although there are no official half-levels. A common example is adaptive cruise control, which also utilizes lane keeping assist technology so that the driver simply monitors the vehicle, such as "Super-Cruise" in the Cadillac CT6 by General Motors or Ford\'s F-150 BlueCruise.|[82]|\n|Level 3| ("eyes off"): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a film. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. This level of automation can be thought of as a co-driver or co-pilot that\'s ready to alert the driver in an orderly fashion when swapping their turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur|[83]| (a car satisfying the international |Automated Lane Keeping Systems| (ALKS) regulations).|[84]|\n|Level 4| ("mind off"): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver\'s seat. However, self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas (|geofenced|) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. slow down and park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that covers selected locations in an area, at a specific time and quantities. |Automated valet parking| is another example.|\n|Level 5| ("steering wheel optional"): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces, all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.|\n|In the formal SAE definition below, an important transition is from SAE Level 2 to SAE Level 3 in which the human driver is no longer expected to monitor the environment continuously. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n|\n|\n|SAE (J3016) Automation Levels|[80]|\n|\n|\n|SAE Level|\n|Name|\n|Narrative definition|\n|Execution of|steering and|acceleration/|deceleration|\n|Monitoring of driving environment|\n|Fallback performance of dynamic driving task|\n|System capability (driving modes)\n|\n|\n|Human driver monitors the driving environment|\n|\n|\n|0|\n|No Automation|\n|The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when "enhanced by warning or intervention systems"|\n|Human driver|\n|Human driver|\n|Human driver|\n|N/a\n|\n|\n|1|\n|Driver Assistance|\n|The driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of |either steering or acceleration/deceleration|\n|Using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task|\n|Human driver and system|\n|Some driving modes\n|\n|\n|2|\n|Partial Automation|\n|The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of |both steering and acceleration/deceleration|\n|System\n|\n|\n|Automated driving system monitors the driving environment|\n|\n|\n|3|\n|Conditional Automation|\n|The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task|\n|With the expectation that the |human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene|\n|System|\n|System|\n|Human driver|\n|Some driving modes\n|\n|\n|4|\n|High Automation|\n|Even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene| the car can pull over safely by guiding system|\n|System|\n|Many driving modes\n|\n|\n|5|\n|Full Automation|\n|Under all roadway and environmental conditions| that can be managed by a human driver|\n|All driving modes\n|\n|Criticism of SAE|[|edit|]|\n|The SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not always be the case.|[85]| The SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure|[86]| and road user behavior.|[87]|[88]|\n|\n|Technology|[|edit|]|\n|This section |is written like a |personal reflection, personal essay, or argumentative essay| that states a Wikipedia editor\'s personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic.| Please |help improve it| by rewriting it in an |encyclopedic style|.| |(|April 2022|)| (|Learn how and when to remove this template message|)|\n|General perspectives|[|edit|]|\n|Several classifications have been proposed to deal with the broad range of technological discussions pertaining to self-driving cars. One such proposal is to classify based on the following categories; car navigation, path planning, environment perception and car control.|[89]| In the 2020s, it became apparent that these technologies are far more complex than initially thought.|[90]|[91]| Even video games have been used as a platform to test autonomous vehicles.|[92]|\n|\n|Hybrid navigation|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Hybrid navigation|\n|Hybrid navigation is the simultaneous use of more than one |navigation system| for location data determination, needed for |navigation|.\n|Sensing|\nTo reliably and safely operate an autonomous vehicle, usually a mixture of sensors is utilized.|[91]|\nTypical sensors include |lidar| (Light Detection and Ranging), |stereo vision|, |GPS| and |IMU|.|[93]|[94]|\nModern self-driving cars generally use |Bayesian| |simultaneous localization and mapping| (SLAM) algorithms,\nwhich fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates.|[95]| \nWaymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians. Simpler systems may use roadside |real-time locating system| (RTLS) technologies to aid localization.\n|Maps|\nSelf-driving cars require a new class of |high-definition maps| (HD maps) that represent the world at up to two orders of magnitude more detail.|[91]| In May 2018, researchers from the |Massachusetts Institute of Technology| (MIT) announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads.|[96]| Researchers at their |Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory| (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a "sparse topological map" such as |OpenStreetMap| (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions.|[97]|\n|Sensor fusion|\nControl systems on automated cars may use |sensor fusion|, which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful view of the environment.|[98]| Self-driving cars tend to use a combination of cameras, LiDAR sensors, and radar sensors in order to enhance performance and ensure the safety of the passenger and other drivers on the road. An increased consistency in self-driving performance prevents accidents that may occur because of one faulty sensor.|[99]|\n|Path planning|\n|Path planning| is a |computational problem| to find a sequence of valid configurations that moves the object from the source to destination. Self-driving cars rely on path planning technology in order to follow the rules of traffic and prevent accidents from occurring. The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a |voronoi diagram|, an |occupancy grid mapping|, or with a driving corridors algorithm.|[100]| A driving corridors algorithm allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open free space that is bounded by lanes or barriers. While these algorithms work in a simple situation, path planning has not been proven to be effective in a complex scenario. Two techniques used for path planning are graph-based search and variational-based optimization techniques. Graph-based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicle/obstacle. Variational-based optimization techniques require a higher level of planning in setting restrictions on the vehicle\'s driving corridor to prevent collisions.|[101]|\n|\n|Drive by wire|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Drive by wire|\n|Drive by wire technology in the automotive industry is the use of electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages.\n|\n|Driver monitoring system|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Driver monitoring system|\n|Driver monitoring system is a vehicle safety system to assess the driver\'s alertness and warn the driver if needed. It is recognized in developer side that the role of the systems will increase as SAE Level 2 systems become more common-place, and becomes more challenging at Level 3 and above to predict the driver\'s readiness for handover.|[102]|\n|\n|Vehicular communication|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Vehicular communication systems|\n|Vehicular communications is a growing area of communications between vehicles and including roadside communication infrastructure. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating |nodes| in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. This connectivity enables autonomous vehicles to interact with non-autonomous traffic and pedestrians to increase safety.|[103]|[104]|\nAnd autonomous vehicles will need to connect to the cloud to update their software and maps, and feedback information to improve the used maps and software of their manufacturer.|[91]|\n|\n|Re-programmable|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Over-the-air programming|\n|Autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle, meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this re-programmable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through |machine learning|, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software.\n|In March 2021, |UNECE| regulation on software update and software update management system was published.|[105]|\n|\n|Modularity|[|edit|]|\n|Autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n|\n|The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers;|\n|On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform;|\n|The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.;|\n|The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content\'s origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, Geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).|\n|Homogenization|[|edit|]|\n|In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Homogenization requires that the digital information from these different sources is transmitted and stored in the same form. This means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored, and computed in a way that the vehicles and their operating system can better understand and act upon it.\n|In international standardization field, |ISO|/TC 22 is in charge of in-vehicle transport information and control systems,|[106]| and ISO/TC 204 is in charge of information, communication and control systems in the field of urban and rural surface transportation.|[107]| International standards have been actively developed in the domains of AD/ADAS functions, connectivity, human interaction, in-vehicle systems, management/engineering, dynamic map and positioning, privacy and security.|[108]|\n|\n|Mathematical safety model|[|edit|]|\n|In 2017, |Mobileye| published a mathematical model for automated vehicle safety which is called "Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)".|[109]|\nIt is under standardization at |IEEE Standards Association| as "IEEE P2846: A Formal Model for Safety Considerations in Automated Vehicle Decision Making".|[110]|\n|In 2022, a research group of |National Institute of Informatics| (NII, Japan) expanded RSS and developed "Goal-Aware RSS" to make RSS rules possible to deal with complex scenarios via program logic.|[111]|\n|\n|Challenges|[|edit|]|\n|Obstacles|[|edit|]|\n|The potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability,|[112]|[113]| the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,|[114]| and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars,|[115]| concerns about safety,|[116]| and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.|[117]| In addition, cyberattacks could be a potential threat to autonomous driving in the future.|[118]|\n|Other obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,|[119]| ethical problems where an automated vehicle\'s software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action (the |trolley problem|),|[120]|[121]| concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed, the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location, association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and pattern-recognition AI, and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds, gestures and non-verbal cues by police, other drivers or pedestrians.|[122]|\n|\n| |Autonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another|\n|Possible technological obstacles for automated cars are:|[|needs update|]|\n|\n|Artificial intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner-city environments.|[123]|\n|A car\'s computer could potentially be compromised, as could a communication system between cars.|[124]|[125]|[126]|[127]|[128]|\n|Susceptibility of the car\'s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather (such as snow) or deliberate interference, including jamming and spoofing.|[122]|\n|Avoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking, and |Volvo| found that software suited to |caribou|, |deer|, and |elk| was ineffective with |kangaroos|.|[129]|\n|Autonomous cars may require |high-definition maps| to operate properly. Where these maps may be out of date, they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors.|\n|Competition for the radio spectrum desired for the car\'s communication.|[130]|\n|Field programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain.|[128]|\n|Current road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally.|[131]|\n|Validation challenge of Automated Driving and need for novel simulation-based approaches comprising digital twins and agent-based traffic simulation.|[132]|\n|Concerns|[|edit|]|\n|Regulation|In the 2010s, researchers openly worried about the potential of future regulation to delay deployment of automated cars on the road.|[133]| However, as written in |UNECE WP.29 GRVA|, international regulation for Level 3 was smoothly established in 2020, and the uncertainty was resolved. As of 2022|[update]|, in practice, it is actually very difficult to be approved as Level 3.\n|Deceptive marketing|\nAs Tesla\'s "Full Self-Driving (FSD)" actually corresponds to Level 2,|[134]| \nsenators called for investigation to the |Federal Trade Commission| (FTC) about their marketing claims in August 2021.|[135]|\nAnd in December 2021 in Japan, Mercedes-Benz Japan Co., Ltd. was punished by the |Consumer Affairs Agency| for the descriptions in their handouts that are different from the fact.|[136]|\n|In July 2016, following |a fatal crash by a Tesla car| operating in "Autopilot" mode, Mercedes-Benz was also slammed for a misleading commercial advertising |E-Class models| which had been available with "Drive Pilot".|[137]|\nAt that time, Mercedes-Benz rejected the claims and stopped its "self-driving car" ad campaign which had been running in the United States.|[138]|[139]|\nIn August 2022, the |California Department of Motor Vehicles| (DMV) accused Tesla of deceptive marketing  practices.|[140]|\n|Employment|\nCompanies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand.|[141]| As such, education and training by third-party organizations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community-driven projects such as DIY Robocars|[142]| and Formula Pi have quickly grown in popularity, while university level extra-curricular programmed such as Formula Student Driver-less|[143]| have bolstered graduate experience. Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources, such as code,|[144]| datasets|[145]| and glossaries|[146]| to widen the recruitment pool.\n|National security|\nIn the 2020s, from the importance of the automotive sector to the nation, self-driving car has become a topic of national security. The concerns regarding cybersecurity and data protection are not only important for user protection, but also in the context of national security. The trove of data collected by self-driving cars, paired with cybersecurity vulnerabilities, creates an appealing target for intelligence collection. Self-driving cars are required to be considered in a new way when it comes to espionage risk.|[147]|\n|It was in July 2018 that a former Apple engineer was arrested by |Federal Bureau of Investigation| (FBI) at |San Jose International Airport| (SJC) while preparing to board a flight to China and charged with stealing proprietary information related to Apple\'s self-driving car project.|[148]|[149]|\nAnd in January 2019, another Apple employee was charged with stealing self-driving car project secrets.|[150]|\nIn July 2021, |United States Department of Justice| (DOJ) accused Chinese security officials of a hacking attack seeking data on  of coordinating a vast hacking campaign to steal sensitive and secret information from government entities including research related to autonomous vehicles.|[151]|[152]|\nOn the China side, they have already prepared "the Provisions on Management of Automotive Data Security (Trial)".|[153]|[154]|\n|It is concerned that |leapfrogging| ability can be applied to autonomous car technology.|[155]|\nAlso, emerging |Cellular V2X| (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) technologies are based on |5G wireless networks|.|[156]|\nAs of November 2022|[update]|, |US Congress| is applying fresh scrutiny to the possibility that imported Chinese technology could be a Trojan horse.|[157]|\n|\n|Human factors|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Human factors and ergonomics|\n|Moving obstacles|\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of  behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.|[10]| Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. |Drive.ai| is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as "going now, don\'t cross" vs. "waiting for you to cross".|[158]|\n|Handover and risk compensation|\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handover from automated driving to manual driving.\nHuman factors research on automated systems has shown that people are slow to detect a problem with automation and slow to understand the problem after it is detected. When automation failures occur, unexpected transitions that require a driver to take over will occur suddenly and the driver may not be ready to take over.|[159]|\n|The second challenge is known as |risk compensation|: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier  behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of |Tesla Autopilot| ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n|Trust|\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.|[160]|[161]| Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.|[162]|[163]| There are three types of trust between human and automation.|[164]| There is dispositional trust, the trust between the driver and the company\'s product;|[164]| there is situational trust, or the trust from different scenarios;|[164]| and there is learned trust where the trust is built between similar events.|[164]|\n|\n|Moral issues|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Machine ethics|Rationale for liability|There are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt.|[165]| One study suggests requesting the owners of self-driving cars to sign end-user license agreements (EULAs), assigning to them accountability for any accidents.|[166]| Other studies suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.|[165]| Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.|[167]|\n|Implications from the Trolley Problem|A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software of a self-driving vehicle is captured in a variation of the traditional ethical thought experiment, the |trolley problem|: An AV is driving with passengers when suddenly a person appears in its way and the car has to commit between one of two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers.|[168]| Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the  behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: |deontology| and |utilitarianism|.|[10]|[169]| Deontological theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, promotes maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.|[10]|[169]| Recently, some specific ethical frameworks i.e., utilitarianism, deontology, relativism, absolutism (monism), and pluralism, are investigated empirically with respect to the acceptance of self-driving cars in unavoidable accidents.|[170]|\n|According to research, people overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas, that is, in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties.|[171]| While people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles, they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs.|[171]| This presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs.|[171]| People disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a self-driving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers.|[171]|\n|Bonnefon et al. concluded that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety.|[171]| This is because, if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in self-protective cars, it could prevent the large scale implementation of self-driving cars.|[171]| Delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives.|[171]|\n|Privacy|Privacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual (see |data mining|). This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car,  behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.|[172]|[173]|[174]| The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and |advanced analytics|.|[172]|\n|\n|Applications|[|edit|]|\n|Robotaxi|\n|\n|Main article: |Robotaxi|\n|Robotaxi is an application of self-driving car which is supposed to be operated by |taxi| company or |ridesharing company|. \nThrough the massive investments by |Big Tech| companies in the mid-2010s, research and development of robotaxi became active in the U.S.|[175]|\n|Self-driving shuttle and bus|\n|\n|Further information: |Vehicular automation §\xa0Shuttle|\n|Self-driving shuttle is an application of self-driving car with considerations of multiple passengers supposing the use cases mainly in cities.

Automation of trucks is important, not only due to the improved safety aspects of these very heavy vehicles, but also due to the ability of fuel savings through |platooning|. Autonomous vans are being developed for use by |online grocers| such as |Ocado|.|[178]|\n|Autonomous micro-mobility|\nResearch has indicated that goods distribution on the macro (urban distribution) and micro level (|last mile delivery|) could be made more efficient with the use of autonomous vehicles|[179]| thanks to the possibility of smaller vehicle sizes.\nAlso, simulation studies in |MIT Media Lab| indicate that ultra-lightweight systems can become more helping to remove cars from our cities by applying autonomous driving technologies.|[180]|\n|In November 2022, |Honda| unveiled the "Honda CI Micro-mobility" machines and their core technologies.

For example, New York has strict requirements for the test driver, such that the vehicle can be corrected at all times by a licensed operator; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company\'s application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.|[189]|\n|\n|Disengagements in the 2010s|[|edit|]|\n| |A prototype of |Waymo|\'s self-driving car, navigating public streets in |Mountain View, California| in 2017|\n|In California, self-driving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to share how often their vehicles disengaged from autonomous mode during tests.|[190]|\nIt has been believed that we would learn how reliable the vehicles are becoming based on how often they needed "disengagements".|[191]|\n|In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545\xa0mi (567,366\xa0km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596\xa0mi (9,006\xa0km) between disengagements, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled a greater total distance than any of the other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000\xa0mi (1,600\xa0km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000\xa0mi (1,600\xa0km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of just 0.67\xa0mi (1.08\xa0km) per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, |Cruise| (now owned by |GM|) averaged 5,224\xa0mi (8,407\xa0km) per disengagement over a total distance of 62,689\xa0mi (100,888\xa0km).|[192]| In July 2018, the first electric driver-less racing car, "Robocar", completed a 1.8-kilometer track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.|[193]|\n|\n|\n|Distance between disengagement and total distance traveled autonomously in the 2010s\n|\n|\n|Car maker\n|\n|California, 2016|[192]|\n|\n|California, 2018|[194]|\n|\n|California, 2019|[195]|\n|\n|\n|Distance between|disengagements\n|\n|Total distance traveled\n|\n|Distance between|disengagements\n|\n|Total distance traveled\n|\n|Distance between|disengagements\n|\n|Total distance traveled\n|\n|\n|Waymo|\n|\n|5,128\xa0mi (8,253\xa0km)\n|\n|635,868\xa0mi (1,023,330\xa0km)\n|\n|11,154\xa0mi (17,951\xa0km)\n|\n|1,271,587\xa0mi (2,046,421\xa0km)\n|\n|11,017\xa0mi (17,730\xa0km)\n|\n|1,450,000\xa0mi (2,330,000\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|BMW|\n|\n|638\xa0mi (1,027\xa0km)\n|\n|638\xa0mi (1,027\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Nissan|\n|\n|263\xa0mi (423\xa0km)\n|\n|6,056\xa0mi (9,746\xa0km)\n|\n|210\xa0mi (340\xa0km)\n|\n|5,473\xa0mi (8,808\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Ford|\n|\n|197\xa0mi (317\xa0km)\n|\n|590\xa0mi (950\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|General Motors|\n|\n|55\xa0mi (89\xa0km)\n|\n|8,156\xa0mi (13,126\xa0km)\n|\n|5,205\xa0mi (8,377\xa0km)\n|\n|447,621\xa0mi (720,376\xa0km)\n|\n|12,221\xa0mi (19,668\xa0km)\n|\n|831,040\xa0mi (1,337,430\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Aptiv|\n|\n|15\xa0mi (24\xa0km)\n|\n|2,658\xa0mi (4,278\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Tesla|\n|\n|3\xa0mi (4.8\xa0km)\n|\n|550\xa0mi (890\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Mercedes-Benz|\n|\n|2\xa0mi (3.2\xa0km)\n|\n|673\xa0mi (1,083\xa0km)\n|\n|1.5\xa0mi (2.4\xa0km)\n|\n|1,749\xa0mi (2,815\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Bosch|\n|\n|7\xa0mi (11\xa0km)\n|\n|983\xa0mi (1,582\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Zoox|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,923\xa0mi (3,095\xa0km)\n|\n|30,764\xa0mi (49,510\xa0km)\n|\n|1,595\xa0mi (2,567\xa0km)\n|\n|67,015\xa0mi (107,850\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Nuro|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,028\xa0mi (1,654\xa0km)\n|\n|24,680\xa0mi (39,720\xa0km)\n|\n|2,022\xa0mi (3,254\xa0km)\n|\n|68,762\xa0mi (110,662\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Pony.ai|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,022\xa0mi (1,645\xa0km)\n|\n|16,356\xa0mi (26,322\xa0km)\n|\n|6,476\xa0mi (10,422\xa0km)\n|\n|174,845\xa0mi (281,386\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Baidu| (|Apolong|)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|206\xa0mi (332\xa0km)\n|\n|18,093\xa0mi (29,118\xa0km)\n|\n|18,050\xa0mi (29,050\xa0km)\n|\n|108,300\xa0mi (174,300\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Aurora|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|100\xa0mi (160\xa0km)\n|\n|32,858\xa0mi (52,880\xa0km)\n|\n|280\xa0mi (450\xa0km)\n|\n|39,729\xa0mi (63,938\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Apple|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1.1\xa0mi (1.8\xa0km)\n|\n|79,745\xa0mi (128,337\xa0km)\n|\n|118\xa0mi (190\xa0km)\n|\n|7,544\xa0mi (12,141\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|Uber|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|0.4\xa0mi (0.64\xa0km)\n|\n|26,899\xa0mi (43,290\xa0km)\n|\n|\n|\n|0\xa0mi (0\xa0km)\n|\n|In the 2020s|[|edit|]|\n|Disengagements|\nAs of 2022|[update]|, "disengagements" are at the center of the controversy. The problem is that reporting companies have varying definitions of what qualifies as a disengagement, and that definition can change over time.|[196]|[191]|\nExecutives of self-driving car companies have criticized disengagements as a deceptive metric, because it does not take into account the higher degree of difficulty navigating urban streets compared with interstates highway.|[197]|\n|Compliance|\nIn April 2021, |WP.29| GRVA issued the master document on "Test Method for Automated Driving (NATM)".|[198]|\n|In October 2021, the Europe\'s comprehensive pilot test of automated driving on public roads, L3Pilot, demonstrated automated systems for cars in |Hamburg|, Germany, in conjunction with |ITS World Congress 2021|. SAE Level 3 and 4 functions were tested on ordinary roads.|[199]|[200]|\nAt the end of February 2022, the final results of the L3Pilot project were published.|[201]|\n|In November 2022, an International Standard ISO 34502 on "Scenario based safety evaluation framework" was published.|[202]|[203]|\n|Collision avoidance|\nIn April 2022, collision avoidance testing was demonstrated by |Nissan|.|[204]|[205]|\nAlso, |Waymo| published a document about collision avoidance testing in December 2022.|[206]|\n|Simulation and validation|\nIn September 2022, Biprogy released a software system of "Driving Intelligence Validation Platform (DIVP)" as the achievement of Japanese national project "SIP-adus" led by |Cabinet Office| with the same name of its subproject which is interoperable with  Open Simulation Interface (OSI) of |ASAM|.|[207]|[208]|[209]|\n|Topics|\nIn November 2021, the |California Department of Motor Vehicles| (DMV) notified |Pony.ai| that it was suspending its driverless testing permit following a reported collision in Fremont on 28 October. This incident stands out because the vehicle was in autonomous mode and didn\'t involve any other vehicle.|[210]|\nIn May 2022, DMV revoked Pony.ai\'s permit for failing to monitor the driving records of the safety drivers on its testing permit.|[211]|\n|In April 2022, it is reported that |Cruise|\'s testing vehicle blocked |fire engine| on emergency call, and sparked questions about an autonomous vehicle\'s ability to handle unexpected roadway issues.|[212]|[213]|\n|In November 2022, |Toyota| gave a demonstration of one of |its GR Yaris| test car equipped with AI, which had been trained on the skills and knowledge of professional rally drivers to enhance the safety of self-driving cars.|[214]| Toyota has been using the learnings from the collaborative activities with |Microsoft| in FIA |World Rally Championship| since 2017 season.|[215]|\n|\n|Incidents|[|edit|]|\n|Tesla Autopilot|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Tesla Autopilot §\xa0Fatal crashes|\n|As of November\xa02021|[update]|, Tesla\'s |advanced driver-assistance system| (ADAS) Autopilot is classified as a Level 2.|[216]|\n|On 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China\'s Hubei province.|[217]| According to China\'s |163.com| news channel, this marked "China\'s first accidental death due to Tesla\'s automatic driving (system)". Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car\'s absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver\'s otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.|[218]|[219]| In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim\'s father documenting that fact.|[220]|\n|The second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in |Williston, Florida| on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S |electric car| was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel |tractor-trailer|. On 28 June 2016 the |US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration| (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the |Florida Highway Patrol|. According to NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck\'s trailer.|[221]|[222]| NHTSA\'s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.|[223]| On 8 July 2016, NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla\'s planned updates schedule for the next four months.|[224]|\n|According to Tesla, "neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied." The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, "with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S". Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla\'s first known autopilot death in over 130\xa0million miles (210\xa0million kilometers) driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94\xa0million miles (151\xa0million kilometers) among all type of vehicles in the US.|[221]|[222]|[225]| However, this number also includes fatalities of the crashes, for instance, of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians.|[226]|[227]|\n|In July 2016, the US |National Transportation Safety Board| (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said "It\'s worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible."|[228]| In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.|[229]|\n|In 2021, NTSB Chair called on Tesla to change the design of its Autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to the company\'s CEO.|[216]|\n|\n|Waymo|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Waymo §\xa0Crashes|\n| |Google\'s in-house |automated car|\n|Waymo originated as a self-driving car project within Google. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000\xa0km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.|[230]| In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated.|[231]| As of March\xa02016|[update]|, Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1,500,000\xa0mi (2,400,000\xa0km).|[232]| In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called |Alphabet|.|[233]|[234]|\n|According to Google\'s accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car\'s software caused a crash.|[235]|\n|In June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.|[236]| In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light. This was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries.|[237]| On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, "In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn\'t moved, there wouldn\'t have been a collision."|[238]|[239]| Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.|[235]|\n|\n|Uber\'s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG)|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Uber §\xa0Former operations|\n|In March 2018, |Elaine Herzberg| died after being hit by a self-driving car being tested by Uber\'s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) in the US state of Arizona. There was a safety driver in the car. Herzberg was crossing the road about 400 feet from an intersection.|[240]| This marks the first time an individual is known to have been killed by an autonomous vehicle, and the incident raised questions about regulation of the self-driving car industry.|[241]| Some experts said a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.|[242]| Arizona governor |Doug Ducey| suspended the company\'s ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an "unquestionable failure" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.|[243]| Uber then stopped self-driving tests in California until it was issued a new permit in 2020.|[244]|[245]|\n|In May 2018, the US |National Transportation Safety Board| (NTSB) issued a preliminary report.|[246]| The final report 18 months later determined that the immediate cause of the accident was the safety driver\'s failure to monitor the road because she was distracted by her phone. However, Uber ATG\'s "inadequate safety culture" contributed to the crash. The report noted from the post-mortem that the victim had "a very high level" of methamphetamine in her body.|[247]| The board also called on federal regulators to carry out a review before allowing automated test vehicles to operate on public roads.|[248]|[249]|\n|In September 2020, the backup driver, Rafael Vasquez, was charged with negligent homicide, because she did not look at the road for several seconds while her phone was streaming |The Voice| broadcast by |Hulu|. She pleaded not guilty and was released to await trial. Uber does not face any criminal charge because in the USA there is no basis for criminal liability for the corporation. The safety driver is assumed to be responsible of the accident, because she was in the driving seat in a capacity to avoid an accident (like in a Level 3). The trial was planned for February 2021.|[250]|[|needs update|]|\n|\n|Navya Arma driving system|[|edit|]|\n|On 9 November 2017, a |Navya| Arma automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply |defensive driving| techniques such as flashing its headlights, or sounding the horn. As one passenger commented, "The shuttle didn\'t have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still."|[251]|\n|\n|NIO Navigate on Pilot|[|edit|]|\n|On 12 August 2021, a 31-year-old Chinese man was killed after his |NIO ES8| collided with a construction vehicle.|[252]| NIO\'s self-driving feature is still in beta and cannot yet deal with static obstacles.|[253]| Though the vehicle\'s manual clearly states that the driver must take over when nearing construction sites, the issue is whether the feature was improperly marketed and unsafe. Lawyers of the deceased\'s family have also called into question NIO\'s private access to the vehicle, which they argue may lead to the data ending up forged.|[254]|\n|\n|Toyota e-Palette operation|[|edit|]|\n|On 26 August 2021, a |Toyota e-Palette|, a mobility vehicle used to support mobility within the Athletes\' Village at the Olympic and |Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020|, collided with a visually impaired pedestrian about to cross a pedestrian crossing.|[255]|\nThe suspension was made after the accident, and restarted on 31 with improved safety measures.|[256]|\n|\n|Public opinion surveys|[|edit|]|\n|In the 2010s|[|edit|]|\n|In a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by |Accenture|, 49% said they would be comfortable using a "driverless car".|[257]|\n|A 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by |J.D. Power and Associates| found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a "fully autonomous car". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.|[258]|\n|In a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.|[259]|\n|A 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by |Cisco Systems| found 57% "stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.|[260]|\n|In a 2014 US telephone survey by |Insurance.com|, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.|[261]|\n|In a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predicted that either |Tesla| or |Daimler| would be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler was predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.|[262]|\nIn 2015, a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.|[263]| The survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either "definitely" or "probably" interested in purchasing an automated car.|[263]|\n|In 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants\' age.|[264]|\n|In 2016, a |PwC| survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that "66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.|[265]|\n|In 2017, Pew Research Center surveyed 4,135 US adults from 1–15 May and found that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes—from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.|[266]|\n|In 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. A new standardized questionnaire, the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM) was developed, including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels. Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.|[267]|\n|\n|In the 2020s|[|edit|]|\n|In 2022, research by safety charity |Lloyd\'s Register Foundation| uncovered that only a quarter (27%) of the world\'s population would feel safe in self-driving cars.|[268]|\n|\n|Regulation|[|edit|]|\n|Main article: |Regulation of self-driving cars|\n|See also: |Regulation of algorithms|\n|Regulation of self-driving cars is an increasingly important issue which includes multiple subtopics. Among them are self-driving car liability, regulations regarding approval and international conventions.\n|\n|Anticipated launch|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Lane centering §\xa0Sample of level 2 automated cars|, and |List of self-driving system suppliers §\xa0Date of first public road driverless operation|\n|Between manually driven vehicles (SAE Level 0) and fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 5), there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of |automation|. These are collectively known as semi-automated vehicles. As it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure are developed for full automation, it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation. These semi-automated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles, while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle.|[269]|\n|\n|Anticipated Level 2|[|edit|]|\n|Tesla vehicles are equipped with hardware that Tesla claims will allow full self driving in the future. In October 2020 Tesla released a "|beta|" version of its "Full Self-Driving" software to a small group of testers in the United States;|[270]| however, this "Full Self-Driving" corresponds to level 2 autonomy.|[271]|\n|\n|Anticipated Level 3|[|edit|]|\n|In 2017, |BMW| had been trying to make |7 Series| as an automated car in public urban motorways of the United States, Germany and Israel before commercializing them in 2021.|[272]| Although it was not realized, BMW is still preparing 7 Series to become the next manufacturer to reach Level 3 in the second half of 2022.|[273]|[274]|\n|In September 2021, |Stellantis| has presented its findings from a pilot programme testing Level 3 autonomous vehicles on public Italian highways.\nStellantis\'s Highway Chauffeur claims Level 3 capabilities, which was tested on the |Maserati Ghibli| and |Fiat 500X| prototypes.|[275]|\nStellantis is going to roll out Level 3 capability within its cars in 2024.|[276]|\n|In January 2022, |Polestar|, a |Volvo Cars|\' brand, indicated its plan to offer Level 3 autonomous driving system in the Polestar 3 SUV, |Volvo XC90| successor, with technologies from |Luminar Technologies|, |Nvidia|, and Zenseact.|[277]|\n|As of February 2022|[update]|, |Hyundai Motor Company| is in the stage of enhancing cybersecurity of connected cars to put Level 3 self-driving |Genesis G90| on Korean roads.|[278]|\n|In December 2022, |Honda| announced that it will enhance its Level 3 technology to function at any speed below legal limits on highways by 2029.|[279]|[280]|\n|In early 2023, |Mercedes-Benz| plans to submit an application for its Level 3 Drive Pilot in California and Nevada for approval by mid-2023.|[281]|\n|\n|Anticipated Level 4|[|edit|]|\n|In July 2020, |Toyota| started testing with public demonstration rides on |Lexus LS| (fifth generation) based TRI-P4 with Level 4 capability.|[282]|\nIn August 2021, Toyota operated potentially Level 4 service using |e-Palette| around the |Tokyo 2020 Olympic| Village.|[283]|\n|In September 2020, |Mercedes-Benz| introduced world\'s first commercial Level 4 |Automated Valet Parking| (AVP) system named |Intelligent Park Pilot| for its new |S-Class|. The system can be pre-installed but is conditional on future national legal approval.|[284]|[285]|\n|In September 2021, |Honda| started testing programme toward launch of Level 4 mobility service business in Japan under collaboration with |Cruise| and |General Motors|, using Cruise AV.|[286]|\nIn October 2021 at |World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems|, Honda presented that they are already testing Level 4 technology on modified |Legend| Hybrid EX.|[287]| \nAt the end of the month, Honda explained that they are conducting verification project on Level 4 technology on a test course in |Tochigi prefecture|. Honda plans to test on public roads in early 2022.|[288]|\n|In February 2022, General Motors and Cruise have petitioned |NHTSA| for permission to build and deploy a self-driving vehicle, the Cruise Origin, which is without human controls like steering wheels or brake pedals. The car was developed with GM and Cruise investor Honda, and its production is expected to begin in late 2022 in |Detroit at GM\'s Factory Zero|.|[289]|[290]|\nAs of April 2022|[update]|, the petition is pending.|[291]|\n|In April 2022, Honda unveiled its Level 4 mobility service partners to roll out in central Tokyo in the mid-2020s using the Cruse Origin.|[292]|\nBy September 2022, Japan version prototype of Cruise Origin for Tokyo was completed and started testing.|[293]|\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|\n|History of self-driving cars|\n|Self-driving car liability|\n|Self-driving truck|\n|Automotive navigation system|\n|Advanced driver-assistance system|\n|Computer vision|\n|Connected car|\n|DARPA Grand Challenge|: |2004|, |2005|, |2007|\n|DARPA Robotics Challenge| (2012)|\n|Dutch Automated Vehicle Initiative|\n|Death by GPS|\n|Driverless tractor|\n|Hybrid navigation|\n|Intelligent transportation system|\n|List of self-driving system suppliers|\n|Machine vision|\n|Mobility as a service|\n|Personal rapid transit|\n|Platoon (automobile)|\n|Retrofitting|\n|Smart camera|\n|Technological unemployment|\n|Unmanned ground vehicle|\n|Unmanned aerial vehicle|\n|Vehicle infrastructure integration|\n|Vehicle safety technology|\n|Vision processing unit|\n|Lane centering|\n|Measurement of Assured Clear Distance Ahead|\n|Electronic stability control|\n|Collision avoidance system|\n|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^ |a| |b| |Taeihagh, Araz; Lim, Hazel Si Min (2 January 2019).

Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular |vehicles| used for road, water or air transport; the source of |energy|; and the |infrastructure| used to accommodate the transport (|roads|, |railways|, |airways|, |waterways|, |canals| and terminals). Transport operations and |logistics| as well as |transit-oriented development| are also involved in evaluation.|[1]| Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the |environmental| and |climate| impacts of the system.|[2]| Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of |world energy consumption| and |carbon dioxide emissions|.|[3]| The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels.|[4]| In 2019, about 95% of the fuel came from fossil sources. The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union is transportation. In 2019 it contributes to about 31% of global emissions and 24% of emissions in the EU. In addition, up to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions have only increased in this one sector.|[5]|[6]| Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector.|[7]| Road transport is also a major contributor to local |air pollution| and |smog|.|[8]|\n|Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve. Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections, and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased |mobility|,|[9]| with poor households benefiting  greatly from |low carbon| transport options.|[10]| The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental, social and economic costs that transport systems pose. Short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in |fuel efficiency| and |vehicle emissions controls| while long-term goals include migrating transportation from |fossil-based energy| to other alternatives such as |renewable energy| and use of other |renewable resources|. The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to |sustainability measurement| and optimization.|[11]|\n|The |United Nations Environment Programme| (UNEP) estimates that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided.|[12]| Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of |black carbon|, a component of |particulate matter|, which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change.|[13]| The links between |greenhouse gas emissions| and particulate matter make |low carbon| transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change; and by improving public health through better |air quality|.|[13]|\n|The social costs of transport include road crashes, air pollution, physical inactivity,|[14]| time taken away from the |family| while |commuting| and vulnerability to |fuel price increases|. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.|[15]| |Traffic congestion| imposes economic costs by wasting people\'s time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services. Traditional |transport planning| aims to improve mobility, especially for vehicles, and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts. But the real purpose of transport is access – to work, education, goods and services, friends and family – and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts, and managing traffic congestion.|[16]| Communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider program of creating more vibrant, livable, |sustainable cities|.\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Definition|\n|2| |Benefits|\n|3| |Environmental impact|\n|4| |Transport and social sustainability|\n|5| |Potential shift to sustainable transport in developing countries|\n|6| |Cities|\n|7| |Policies and governance|\n|\n|7.1| |By country and city|\n|\n|7.1.1| |United Kingdom|\n|7.1.2| |Germany|\n|7.1.3| |United States|\n|7.1.4| |France|\n|\n|\n|7.2| |In the city level|\n|7.3| |Community and grassroots action|\n|7.4| |Sustainable development|\n|\n|\n|8| |Recent trends|\n|\n|8.1| |Greenwashing|\n|\n|\n|9| |Tools and incentives|\n|\n|9.1| |Possible measures for urban transport|\n|\n|\n|10| |History|\n|\n|10.1| |Mass motorization|\n|10.2| |Mobility transition|\n|\n|\n|11| |See also|\n|12| |References|\n|13| |Bibliography|\n|14| |External links|\n|\n|\n|\n|Definition|[|edit|]|\n| |Ekorent\'s electric car in |Helsinki|, |Finland|\n|The term |sustainable transport| came into use as a logical follow-on from |sustainable development|, and is used to describe modes of transport, and systems of transport planning, which are consistent with wider concerns of |sustainability|. There are many definitions of the sustainable transport, and of the related terms |sustainable transportation| and |sustainable mobility|.|[17]| One such definition, from the |European Union| Council of Ministers of Transport, defines a sustainable transportation system as one that:\n|\n|Allows the basic access and development needs of individuals, companies and society to be met safely and in a manner consistent with human and |ecosystem health|, and promotes equity within and between successive generations.|\n|Is affordable, operates fairly and efficiently, offers a choice of |transport mode|, and supports a |competitive economy|, as well as balanced regional development.|\n|Limits emissions and waste within the planet\'s ability to absorb them, uses |renewable resources| at or below their rates of generation, and uses non-renewable resources at or below the rates of development of renewable substitutes, while minimizing the impact on the |use of land| and the generation of |noise|.|\n|there is a need for people to do sustainable development\nSustainability extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions. A |life-cycle assessment| involves production, use and post-use considerations. A |cradle-to-cradle design| is more important than a focus on a single factor such as |energy efficiency|.|[18]|[19]|\n|\n|Benefits|[|edit|]|\n|Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of serious reports by the |Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)|, sustainable transport can help create jobs,|[20]| improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes, pedestrian pathways and non-pedestrian pathways,|[21]| make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people\'s time and household income as well as government budgets,|[22]| making investment in sustainable transport a \'win-win\' opportunity.\n|\n|Environmental impact|[|edit|]|\n|Main articles: |Green vehicle|, |electric bus|, and |light rail|\n| |The |bus rapid transit| of |Metz| uses a |diesel-electric hybrid| driving system, developed by Belgian |Van Hool| manufacturer.|[23]|\n| |Electric |Transmetro| in |Guatemala City|\n|Transport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases, responsible for 23% of world energy-related GHG emissions in 2004, with about three quarters coming from road vehicles. Data from 2011 stated that one-third of all greenhouse gases produced are due to transportation.|[24]| Currently 95% of transport energy comes from petroleum.|[7]| Energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles, and is |embodied| in transport infrastructure including roads, bridges and railways.|[25]| Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.|[26]|\n|The first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to |Theodore Von Karman|.|[27]| After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model, Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced a model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis.|[28]| Chester and Orwath,|[29]|[30]|[31]| have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure.\n|The |environmental impacts of transport| can be reduced by reducing the weight of vehicles,|[32]| sustainable styles of driving, reducing the friction of tires, encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles, improving the walking and |cycling environment| in cities, and by enhancing the role of |public transport|, especially |electric rail|.|[7]|\n|Green vehicles| are intended to have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when the environmental impact of a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its |life cycle| this may not be the case.|[33]|\n|Electric vehicle| technology has the potential to reduce transport CO|2| emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity.|[34]| In countries with a significant share of coal in their electricity production, adoptation of electric vehicles has only a small climate benefit or none at all. The climate benefits vary substantially and depend on the vehicle size, electricity emissions, driving patterns, and even the weather. As an example, a |Nissan Leaf| in the UK in 2019 produced one third of the greenhouse gases than the average internal combustion car.|[35]|\n|The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24\xa0km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100\xa0kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17\xa0cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface. At that power, only a few sections of the road need embedded cables.|[36]| |Hybrid vehicles|, which use an |internal combustion engine| combined with an |electric engine| to achieve better |fuel efficiency| than a regular combustion engine, are already common.\n|Natural gas| is also used as a transport fuel, but is a less promising technology as it is still a fossil fuel and still has significant emissions (though lower than gasoline, diesel, etc.).\n|Brazil met 17% of its transport fuel needs from |bioethanol| in 2007, but the |OECD| has warned that the success of (first-generation) biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances. Internationally, first-generation biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions, at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures.|[37]|\nThe later generation biofuels however (2nd to 4th generation) do have significant environmental benefit, as they are no driving force for deforestation or struggle with the |food vs fuel| issue. Other |renewable fuels| include hydrogen, which (like drop-in biofuels) |can be used in internal combustion vehicles|, don\'t rely on any crops at all (instead it\'s produced using electricity) and even generates very little pollution when burned.\n|In practice there is a sliding scale of |green transport| depending on the sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more |fuel-efficient|, but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronized |public transport| networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles.|[38]| Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and |electric buses| combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are |cycling| and other |human-powered vehicles|, and |animal powered transport|. The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is |walking|.\n|Transport on rails boasts an excellent efficiency (see |fuel efficiency in transportation|).\n|\n|Transport and social sustainability|[|edit|]|\n| |A tram in |Melbourne|, |Australia|\n|Cities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences, linked to radical drops in |public transport|, |walking|, and |cycling|. In many cases, streets became void of “life.” Stores, schools, government centers and libraries moved away from central cities, and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services. As schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic; the number of cars on US roads between 7:15 and 8:15\xa0a.m. increases 30% during the school year.|[39]|\n|Yet another impact was an increase in |sedentary lifestyles|, causing and complicating a national epidemic of |obesity|, and accompanying dramatically increased health care costs.|[14]|[40]|\n|Car-based transport systems| present barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods,|[41]| with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income.|[42]|\n|\n|\n|Potential shift to sustainable transport in developing countries|[|edit|]|\n|In developing countries such as Uganda, researchers have sought to determine factors that could possibly influence travelers to opt for bicycles as an alternative to motorcycle taxis (Bodaboda). The findings suggest that generally, the age, gender, and ability of the individual to cycle in the first place are key determinants of their willingness to shift to a more sustainable mode. Transport system improvements that could reduce the perceived risks of cycling were also seen to be the most impactful changes that could contribute towards the greater use of bicycles.|[43]|\n|\n|Cities|[|edit|]|\n| |Futurama|, an exhibit at the 1939 New York World\'s Fair, was sponsored by |General Motors| and showed a vision of the City of Tomorrow.|\n|Main article: |Transit-oriented development|\n|Further information: |Carfree city|\n|Cities are shaped by their transport systems. In |The City in History|, |Lewis Mumford| documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a walkable center, often located near a port or waterway, and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or, later, by rail or tram lines.\n|In 1939, the |New York World\'s Fair| included a model of an imagined city, built around a car-based transport system. In this "greater and better world of tomorrow", residential, commercial and industrial areas were separated, and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways. These ideas captured the popular imagination, and are credited with influencing city planning from the 1940s to the 1970s.|[44]|\n|\n| |Interstate 10| and |Interstate 45| near downtown |Houston|, |Texas|\n|The popularity of the car in the post-war era led to major changes in the structure and function of cities.|[45]| There was some opposition to these changes at the time. The writings of |Jane Jacobs|, in particular |The Death and Life of Great American Cities| provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation, and a record of community efforts to resist these changes. Lewis Mumford asked "is the city for cars or for people?"|[46]| |Donald Appleyard| documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in "The View from the Road" (1964) and in the UK, |Mayer Hillman| first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in 1971.|[47]| Despite these notes of caution, trends in car ownership,|[48]| car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post-war period.\n|Mainstream transport planning in Europe has, by contrast, never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility. For example, the |Dutch| Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met "if the contribution to societal welfare is positive", and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic.|[49]| Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to |land-use planning|, notably |Curitiba, Brazil|, |Portland, Oregon| and |Vancouver, Canada|.\n|\n| |Greenhouse gas emissions from transport vary widely, even for cities of comparable wealth. Source: |UITP|, Mobility in Cities Database.|\n|There are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for |private transport| than a Chinese urban resident, and almost four times as much as a European urban dweller. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of |walking|, |cycling|, and |public transport| use and to enduring features of the city including |urban density| and urban design.|[50]|\n|\n| |A bypass in the Old Town in |Szczecin|, Poland|\n|The cities and nations that have invested most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita |fossil fuel| use.|[50]| The social and economic sustainability of car-based |transportation engineering| has also been questioned. Within the United States, residents of |sprawling| cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighborhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often.|[51]| It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American.|[52]| A less car intensive means of urban transport is |carsharing|, which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to |The Economist|, carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles.|[53]| Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like |Zoom| in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries in an effort to reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand the number of people who have access to cars.|[54]|\n|The |European Commission| adopted the |Action Plan on urban mobility| on 30 September 2009 for sustainable urban mobility. The European Commission will conduct a review of the implementation of the Action Plan in the year 2012, and will assess the need for further action. In 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are key to growth and employment. Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants. Around 85% of the EU\'s |GDP| is generated in cities. Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental (|CO|2|, |air pollution|, |noise|) and competitiveness (|congestion|) terms while at the same time addressing social concerns. These range from the need to respond to |health| problems and |demographic| trends, fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of |persons with reduced mobility|, families and children.|[55]|\n|The |C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group| (C40) is a group of 94 cities around the world driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health and wellbeing of urban citizens. In October 2019, by signing the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration, 35 mayors recognized that breathing clean air is a human right and committed to work together to form a global coalition for clean air.|[56]|\n|\n|Policies and governance|[|edit|]|\n| |Seven sustainable transportations in one photo (|Prague|)|\n| |Carbon emissions per passenger|\n|By country and city|[|edit|]|\n|United Kingdom|[|edit|]|\n|In 2021 the |Institute for Public Policy Research| issued a statement saying that car use in the United Kingdom must shrink while |active transport| and |public transport| should be used more. The |Department for Transport| responded that they will spend 2 billion pounds on active transport, more than ever, including making England and the rest of the UK\'s railways greener.|[57]|\n|\n|Germany|[|edit|]|\n|Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.|[58]| An example is the modification in available transportation in |Freiburg, Germany|. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.|[24]|\n|\n|United States|[|edit|]|\n|Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.|[24]| Therefore, California, is one of the highest |greenhouse gases| emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:\n|\n|Improve public transport through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.|[59]|\n|Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.|\n|Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.|[60]|\n|Other states and nations have built efforts to |translate knowledge| in |behavioral economics| into |evidence-based| |sustainable transportation| policies.|[61]|\n|\n|France|[|edit|]|\n|In March 2022, an advertising regulation will come into force in France, requiring all advertising materials for automobiles to include one of three standard disclaimers promoting the use of sustainable transport practices. This applies to all vehicles, including electric vehicles. In 2028, it will also become illegal to advertise vehicles which emit more than 128 grams of carbon dioxide per-kilometre.|[62]|[63]|\n|\n|In the city level|[|edit|]|\n|See also: |Urban sprawl|\n|Sustainable transport policies have their greatest impact at the city level.\n|Some of the biggest cities in Western Europe have a relatively sustainable transport. In |Paris| 53% of trips are made by walking, 3% by bicycle, 34% by public transport, and only 10% by car. In the entire |Ile-de-France| region, walking is the most popular way of transportation. In |Amsterdam|,  28% of trips are made by walking, 31%  by bicycle, 18% by public transport and only 23% by car.|[64]| In |Copenhagen| 62% of people commute to school or work by bicycle.|[65]|\n|Outside Western Europe, cities which have consistently included sustainability as a key consideration in transport and land use planning include |Curitiba, Brazil|; |Bogota, Colombia|; |Portland, Oregon|; and |Vancouver, Canada|. The |state of Victoria|, |Australia| passed legislation in 2010 – the |Transport Integration Act|[66]| – to compel its transport agencies to actively consider sustainability issues including climate change impacts in transport policy, planning and operations.|[67]|\n|Many other cities throughout the world have recognized the need to link sustainability and transport policies, for example by joining the |Cities for Climate Protection program|.|[68]|\n|\n|Oil price| trend, 1939–2007, both nominal and adjusted to inflation|Vehicle-miles traveled in the United States up to March 2009.|\n|Some cities are trying to become |car-free cities|, e.g., limit or exclude the usage of cars.|[69]|\n|In 2020, the |COVID-19 pandemic| pushed several cities to adopt a plan to drastically increase |biking| and |walking|; these included |Milan|, |London|, |Brighton|, and |Dublin|. These plans were taken to facilitate |social distancing| by avoiding public transport and at the same time prevent a rise in |traffic congestion| and air pollution from increase in car use.|[70]|[71]| A similar plan was adopted by |New York City|[72]| and |Paris|.|[73]| The pandemic\'s impact on urban public transportation means revenue declines will put a strain on operators\' finances and may cause creditworthiness to worsen. Governments might be forced to subsidize operators with financial transfers, in turn reducing resources available for investment in greener transportation systems.|[74]|[75]|[76]|\n|\n|Community and grassroots action|[|edit|]|\n|Sustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement, albeit one which is now recognized as of citywide, national and international significance.\n|Whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns, over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues, and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations, including the fast-growing population of older citizens. Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise, pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own, or cannot drive cars, and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden.|[77]|\n|An organization called |Greenxc| started in 2011 created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to |carpool| by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage, posts and photography.|[78]| Ride-sharing reduces individual\'s carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars.\n|At the beginning of the 21st century, some companies are trying to increase the use of |sailing ships|, even for commercial purposes, for example, Fairtrannsport and|[79]| New Dawn Traders|[80]| They have created the |Sail Cargo Alliance|.|[81]|\n|\n|Sustainable development|[|edit|]|\n|There are various |Sustainable Development Goals| (SDGs) that are promoting sustainable transport in order to meet the defined goals. These include |SDG 3| on health (increased road safety), |SDG 7| on energy, |SDG 8| on decent work and economic growth, |SDG 9| on resilient infrastructure, |SDG 11| on sustainable cities (access to transport and expanded public transport), |SDG 12| on sustainable consumption and production (ending |fossil fuel subsidies|) and SDG 14 on oceans, seas and marine resources.|[82]|\n|\n|Recent trends|[|edit|]|\n| |The global stock of electric vehicles grew steadily through the 2010s.|[83]|\n| |Overall GHG from transport|Car travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century, but trends since 2000 have been more complex. |Oil price rises from 2003| have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the US,|[84]| Britain and Australia. In 2008, global oil consumption fell by 0.8% overall, with significant declines in consumption in North America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia.|[85]|\n|Other factors affecting a decline in driving, at least in America, include the retirement of |Baby Boomers| who now drive less, preference for other travel modes (such as transit) by younger age cohorts, the |Great Recession|, and the rising use of technology (internet, mobile devices) which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive.|[86]|\n|\n|Greenwashing|[|edit|]|\n|The term |green transport| is often used as a |greenwash| marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a \n|\n| |Share of firms in the EU and the US taking action on climate by including sustainable transport options.|\n|positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance the |Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman| has targeted car manufacturers who claim that their cars are "green", "clean" or "|environmentally friendly|". Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words.|[87]| The |Australian Competition & Consumer Commission| (ACCC) describes "green" claims on products as "very vague, inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them".|[88]| In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its |green| marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court to be "misleading".|[89]|\n|\n|Tools and incentives|[|edit|]|\n| |Anthropogenic per capita emissions of greenhouse gases by country by the year 2000|Several European countries are opening up financial incentives that support more sustainable modes of transport. The |European Cyclists\' Federation|, which focuses on daily cycling for transport, has created a document containing a non-complete overview.|[90]| In the |UK|, employers have for many years been providing employees with financial incentives. The employee leases or borrows a bike that the employer has purchased. You can also get other support. The scheme is beneficial for the employee who saves money and gets an incentive to get exercise integrated in the daily routine. The employer can expect a tax deduction, lower sick leave and less pressure on parking spaces for cars.|[91]|[92]| Since 2010, there has been a scheme in |Iceland| (Samgöngugreiðslur) where those who do not drive a car to work, get paid a lump of money monthly. An employee must sign a statement not to use a car for work more often than one day a week, or 20% of the days for a period. Some employers pay fixed amounts based on trust. Other employers reimburse the expenses for repairs on bicycles, period-tickets for public transport and the like. Since 2013, amounts up to ISK 8000 per month have been tax-free. Most major workplaces offer this, and a significant proportion of employees use the scheme. Since 2019 half the amount is tax-free if the employee signs a contract not to use a car to work for more than 40% of the days of the contract period.|[93]|[94]|\n|Possible measures for urban transport|[|edit|]|\n|The |EU| |Directorate-General for Transport and Energy| (DG-TREN) has launched a program which focusses mostly on urban transport. Its main measures are:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Clean fuels and vehicles|\n|Animal-powered transport|\n|Biodiesel|\n|Biogas/|CNG|\n|Electric vehicles|\n|Human-powered transport|\n|Hybrid vehicles|\n|Hydrogen vehicle|\n|LPG|\n|Sailing ships|\n|Sustainable (green) transport infrastructure\n|Bikeways|\n|Busways|\n|Greenways| and |foreshoreways|\n|Railways|\n|Access restrictions\n|Access management / enforcement|\n|Car restricted zones / |living streets|\n|Multifunctional areas|\n|Parking| management|\n|Pedestrian zone|\n|Traffic calming| / speed reduction|\n|Integrated pricing strategies\n|Congestion pricing|\n|Integrated ticketing|\n|Parking management|\n|\n|\n|Collective passenger transport\n|Accessible transport systems|\n|Bus rapid transit|\n|Bus services|\n|Demand responsive transport|\n|Integrated ticketing|\n|Intermodal transfers|\n|Marketing|\n|Paratransit|\n|Park & Ride|\n|Public transport|\n|Quality of service|\n|Rail transport|\n|Security, including |transit police|\n|Travel information\n|Public transport route planners| (|intermodal| |journey planner|)|\n|Less car intensive lifestyle\n|Bike sharing|\n|List of bicycle-sharing systems|\n|Car pooling|\n|Car sharing|\n|Car/driver license exit strategies|\n|Cycling|\n|\n|\n|Soft measures\n|Travel blending|\n|Travel plan|\n|Personalised travel plan|\n|Walking school bus|\n|Transport management\n|New urbanism| and New pedestrianism|\n|TDM Toolbox|[95]|\n|Transit oriented development|\n|Transportation demand management|\n|Walkability|\n|Sustainable |freight| transport\n|Clean vehicles / clean fleet|\n|Dry port|\n|Fleet management|\n|Intermodal freight transport|\n|Route planning|\n|Transportation management system|\n|\n|History|[|edit|]|\n|Further information: |History of transport|\n|Most of the tools and concepts of sustainable transport were developed before the phrase was coined. |Walking|, the first mode of transport, is also the most sustainable.|[96]| |Public transport| dates back at least as far as the invention of the public bus by |Blaise Pascal| in 1662.|[97]| The first |passenger tram| began operation in 1807 and the |first passenger rail service| in 1825. |Pedal bicycles| date from the 1860s. These were the only personal transport choices available to most people in Western countries prior to |World War II|, and remain the only options for most people in the developing world. Freight was moved by human power, animal power or rail.\n|\n|Mass motorization|[|edit|]|\n|The post-war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods. The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979,|[48]| with similar trends in other Western nations. Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways, which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity. Transport planning became a branch of |Urban Planning| and identified |induced demand| as a pivotal change from "predict and provide" toward a sustainable approach incorporating |land use planning| and |public transit|. Public investment in transit, walking and |cycling| declined dramatically in the United States, Great Britain and Australia, although this did not occur to the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe.|[38]|[98]|\n|Concerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the |1973 oil crisis| and the |1979 energy crisis|. The high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel.\n|Transport innovations dating from this period include |high-occupancy vehicle lanes|, citywide |carpool| systems and |transportation demand management|. |Singapore| implemented |congestion pricing| in the late 1970s, and |Curitiba| began implementing its |Bus Rapid Transit| system in the early 1980s.\n|Relatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from 1980 to 2000, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as |urban sprawl|. Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for |just in time| deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic.\n|At the same time, the academic foundations of the "predict and provide" approach to transport were being questioned, notably by |Peter Newman| in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid-1980s.|[99]|\n|\nThe British Government\'s White Paper on Transport|[100]| marked a change in direction for transport planning in the UK. In the introduction to the White Paper, Prime Minister |Tony Blair| stated that|\n|We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face. It would be environmentally irresponsible – and would not work.\n|\n|\n|A companion document to the White Paper called "Smarter Choices" researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain, and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20%.|[101]|\n|A similar study by the United States Federal Highway Administration,|[102]| was also released in 2004 and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy.\n|\n|Mobility transition|[|edit|]|\n|This section is an excerpt from |Mobility transition|.|[|edit|]|\n| |Hermann Knoflacher| has been criticising |auto cities| and |car dependency| for decades. With his |walking gear|, he caricatures the enormous spatial demands of motorised private transport (2007)|\n|Mobility transition|[103]|[104]| is a set of social, technological and political processes of converting |traffic| (including |freight transport|) and |mobility| to sustainable transport with |renewable energy| resources, and an integration of several different modes of |private transport| and local |public transport|. It also includes |social change|, a redistribution of |public spaces|,|[105]| and different ways of financing and spending money in |urban planning|. The main motivation for mobility transition is the reduction of the harm and damage that traffic causes to people (mostly but not solely due to |collisions|) and the |environment| (which also often directly or indirectly affects people) in order to make (urban) society more livable, as well as solving various interconnected logistical, social, economic and energy issues and inefficiencies.|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|\n|Alternatives to car use|\n|Circular economy|\n|Cyclability|\n|Ecological modernization|\n|Electric bicycle|\n|Energy efficiency in transport|\n|Environmental impact of aviation|\n|Environmental impact of shipping|\n|Free public transport|\n|Freeway removal|\n|Green building|\n|Green infrastructure|\n|Green transport hierarchy|\n|Hypermobility|\n|Localism|\n|Modal share|\n|Michael Replogle|\n|Road reallocation|\n|Solar vehicle|\n|Sustainable architecture|\n|Sustainable aviation fuel|\n|Sustainable biofuel|\n|Sustainable distribution|\n|Urban vitality|\n|Wind-powered vehicle|\n|\n|Groups:|\n|\n|EcoMobility Alliance|\n|Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|\n|International Association of Public Transport|\n|Michelin Challenge Bibendum|\n|References|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^| |"Sustainable city"|. |HiSoUR - Hi So You Are|. 2018-10-04|.

Such systems combine the low unit costs of |mass production| processes with the flexibility of individual customization.|Mass customization is the new frontier in business for both manufacturing and service industries. At its core, is a tremendous increase in variety and customization without a corresponding increase in costs. At its limit, it is the mass production of individually customized goods and services. At its best, it provides strategic advantage and economic value.|[1]| It is one of the product design strategies and is currently used with both techniques (delay differentiation and modular design) together with effective innovative climate to enhance the value delivered to customers.|[2]|\n|Mass customization is the method of "effectively |postponing| the task of differentiating a product for a specific customer until the latest possible point in the supply network".|[3]| Kamis, Koufaris and Stern (2008) conducted experiments to test the impacts of mass customization when postponed to the stage of retail, online shopping. They found that users perceive greater usefulness and enjoyment with a mass customization interface vs. a more typical shopping interface, particularly in a task of moderate complexity.|[4]| From collaborative engineering perspective, mass customization can be viewed as collaborative efforts between customers and manufacturers, who have different sets of priorities and need to jointly search for solutions that best match customers\' individual specific needs with manufacturers\' customization capabilities.|[5]|\n|The concept of mass customization is attributed to Stan Davis in |Future Perfect|,|[6]| and was defined by |Tseng & Jiao (2001|, p.\xa0685) as "producing goods and services to meet individual customers\' needs with near mass production efficiency". |Kaplan & Haenlein (2006)| concurred, calling it "a strategy that creates value by some form of company-customer interaction at the fabrication and assembly stage of the operations level to create customized products with production cost and monetary price similar to those of mass-produced products". Similarly, |McCarthy (2004|, p.\xa0348)| harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFMcCarthy2004 (|help|)| highlights that mass customization involves balancing operational drivers by defining it as "the capability to manufacture a relatively high volume of product options for a relatively large market (or collection of niche markets) that demands customization, without tradeoffs in cost, delivery and quality".\n|\n|Contents|\n|\n|1| |Implementation|\n|2| |Variants|\n|3| |See also|\n|4| |Notes|\n|5| |References|\n|\n|\n|Implementation|[|edit|]|\n|Many implementations of mass customization are operational today, such as |software|-based product configurators that make it possible to add and/or change functionalities of a core product or to build fully custom enclosures from scratch. This degree of mass customization, however, has only seen limited adoption. If an enterprise\'s marketing department offers individual products (atomic market fragmentation), it doesn\'t often mean that a product is produced individually, but rather that similar variants of the same |mass-produced| item are available. Additionally, in a fashion context, existing technologies to predict clothing size from user input data have been shown to be not yet of high enough suitability for mass customisation purposes.|[7]|\n|Companies that have succeeded with mass-customization business models tend to supply purely electronic products.|[8]| However, these are not true "mass customizers" in the original sense, since they do not offer an alternative to mass production of material goods.\n|\n|Variants|[|edit|]|\n|Pine (1992)| harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFPine1992 (|help|)| described four types of mass customization:|[1]|\n|\n|Collaborative customization (also considered |co-creation|) – Firms talk to individual customers to determine the precise |product offering| that best serves the customer\'s needs (see |personalized marketing| and personal marketing orientation). This information is then used to specify and manufacture a product that suits that specific customer. For example, some clothing companies will manufacture pants or jackets to fit an individual customer. This is also being taken into deeper customization via 3D printing with companies like |Shapeways|.  Examples: |Tailored suits|; |Converse| lets consumers chose the color or pattern of every element of certain types of shoes, either in-store or online.|\n|Adaptive customization – Firms produce a standardized product, but this product is customizable in the hands of the |end-user| (the customers alter the product themselves). Example: |Lutron| lights, which are programmable so that customers can easily customize the aesthetic effect.|[9]|\n|Transparent customization – Firms provide individual customers with unique products, without explicitly telling them that the products are customized. In this case there is a need to accurately assess customer needs. Example: Google |AdWords| and |AdSense|\n|Cosmetic customization – Firms produce a standardized physical product, but market it to different customers in unique ways. Example: Soft Drink served in: A can, 1.25L bottle, 2L bottle.|[|clarification needed|]|\n|He suggested a business model, "the 8.5-figure-path", a process going from |invention| to mass production to |continuous improvement| to mass customization and back to invention.\n|\n|See also|[|edit|]|\n|Configurator|\n|Dell|\n|Industry 4.0|\n|Knowledge-based configuration|\n|Long tail|\n|Mail merge|\n|Manufacturing|\n|Personalization|\n|Personalized marketing|\n|Product differentiation|\n|Product management|\n|Prosumer|\n|Rapid manufacturing|\n|Responsive computer-aided design|\n|Structure chart|\n|Variable data printing|\n|Notes|[|edit|]|\n|\n|\n|^ |a| |b| |Pine, B.
